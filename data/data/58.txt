2817,224332,TRCB,Should Value Investors Pick Two River Bancorp  TRCB  Stock ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Two River Bancorp   NASDAQ TRCB   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Two River Bancorp has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 9  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 44  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Two River Bancorp  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 12 81 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  However  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 95  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Two River Bancorp has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 10 93  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Two River Bancorp has a P S ratio of about 2 44  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 13 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Two River Bancorp currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Two River Bancorp a solid choice for value investors For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 9 83  which is better than the industry average of 11 01  Clearly  TRCB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Two River Bancorp might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and Momentum Score of C  This gives TRCB a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen one upward revision compared to none downward in the past sixty days  whereas the next year estimate has also seen one upward revision compared to none downward revision in the same time period As a result  the current year consensus estimate increased 1 5  in the past two months  whereas the next year estimate decreased 1 39   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Two River Bancorp Price and Consensus   Notably  the stock with a solid earnings surprise history and favorable estimate trends has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term 
Bottom LineTwo River Bancorp is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  the Zacks Rank  2 also indicates robust growth potential in the near future So  value investors might want to delve deeper in this stock as it appears to be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ",2019-05-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-pick-two-river-bancorp-trcb-stock-200426526,200426526

2824,224339,TRCB,5 Stocks To Buy As Rate Hike Prospects Rise	,opinion,On Friday  comments from key Fed officials heightened prospects of a rate hike in the near term  The traditionally dovish Eric Rosengreen signaled that refraining from hiking rates any longer could harm the economy  Meanwhile  Daniel Tarullo sought further indications of rising inflation but added that he was open to a rate hike this year Meanwhile  Fed Governor Lael Brainard is due to speak on policy issues at an event on Monday  Historically known for her dovish approach  it is expected that she may adopt a different stance so as to raise market expectations about a hike  These events indicate that a near term rate hike is in the offing and it may be a good idea to pick stocks likely to benefit in such an event Officials Strike Hawkish ToneBoston Fed President Eric Rosengreen said that the Fed was running the risk of harming the economy if it held off raising rates for too long  Instead  steadily raising rates may be a more appropriate approach  Rosengreen admitted that external economic weaknesses remain a concern  However  he felt the U S  economy had shown enough resilience in the face of such worries Rosengreen felt the central bank runs the chance of overheating the economy if it holds off raising rates any longer  Speaking to CNBC  Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo said he was looking for further evidence of steady inflation before taking another rate hike into consideration  However  Tarullo refused to rule out a rate hike later this year altogether Banks  Insurers to GainRosengreen s hawkish comments led to a broad downturn in stocks on Friday  The S P 500 lost 2 5  on Friday  suffering its worst decline in two months  However  barring an overall market decline  stocks of banks and insurers are likely to gain going forward and such signs are already evident The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index which comprises several large banks  such as Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC   and Bank of America   NYSE BAC    increased 7  in August while the S P 500 declined marginally  The index remains in the red year to date but several factors may already be working in the favor of stocks from these sectors A hike in rates will unequivocally benefit banks and insurers  Firstly  profits for banks rise when rates move higher  since their spread will also increase  Secondly  most bank stocks are trading at a cheaper price compared to the overall market  This is also what makes them likely to succeed moving forward  While benchmarks suffered a grievous fall last Friday  the KBW Nasdaq Bank lost only 1  Similarly  the SPDR S P Insurance ETF  KIE  lost slightly more than 1   The index gained more than 4  over the month of August  For insurance companies  investment income forms a major revenue component  A low rate puts pressure on investment income and in turn on investment yields  Hence any increase in the interest rate would lead to gains for insurers   Read  Our ChoicesAt this point  it is difficult to predict whether the Fed will indeed raise rates at its September meeting  But given the tone of the comments of Fed officials  the likelihood of a rate hike in the near term seems to have increased Adding stocks which will gain from higher rates would a smart choice at this point  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks

2859,224374,ARTX,FLIR Systems Enjoying Solid Backlog  Risks To Profit Remain,opinion,"On Nov 29  we issued an updated research report on Wilsonville  OR based FLIR Systems Inc    NASDAQ FLIR    FLIR Systems designs  manufactures and markets thermal imaging and broadcast camera systems for applications in the commercial and government markets  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Year to date  FLIR Systems  shares have recorded an average return of 25 7   slightly lower than that of the Zacks categorized Electronics Military Systems Market industry average of 28 5   The company has a dismal track record characterized by consecutive earnings misses in the four trailing quarters  largely due to rising operating costs and intensifying competition in retail channels 
Further  the company s earnings estimates have moved south over the past one month  Analysts have revised the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 earnings slightly downward over the past 30 days  from  1 62 to  1 61 per share  which is a bearish sign 
FLIR Systems  business is vulnerable to political uncertainty and currency volatility across the globe  especially given the recent strength in the U S  dollar  These apart  macroeconomic woes are also pressurizing certain end markets of the company  thus adding to its woes 
Particularly  the company s gross profit is vulnerable to a host of factors  including product mix changes  manufacturing cost absorption  adjustments in inventory and rise in competitive pressure in security retail channels  During the recently reported third quarter 2016 results  the company booked a  2 million charge for its defective SkyWatch surveillance towers  which have hurt profits  The company is still working to trace all the faulty units  and this poses a huge risk to profits as the liability could rise as high as  20 million  Thus  the profitability of this company depends on its ability to check the rise in costs in the coming quarters 
Presently  the company is focusing on improving operating efficiency and cost structure to bring margins back to the growth track  As a result of these cost control measures  operating profit margins in third quarter 2016 expanded 380 basis points sequentially 
FLIR SYSTEMS Price and Consensus
   Meanwhile  the company s Security segment is grappling with stiff competition in its retail channels and will most likely hurt its growth prospects  We believe that these short term headwinds might limit the company s growth momentum in the near term 
On the positive side  FLIR Systems is optimistic about its solid bookings and backlog during the recent quarters and believes it will fuel future growth  The company s fundamental business strength and growth prospects are reflected in its solid backlog levels  as it finished the year with total 12 month order backlog of  644 million  representing 13  sequential growth and the highest backlog level since 2008  We believe strategic restructuring activities and solid backlog levels indicate the company s resiliency  which will help it sail through difficult economic times and drive growth  Also  the company s improved working capital utilization is resulting in robust cash flow  which adds to its strength 
Furthermore  FLIR Systems has consistently pursued acquisitions to boost its core and non core businesses  In the third quarter  the company s commercial product revenues benefited significantly from the newly acquired products of DVTEL and Armasight 
Also  last month  FLIR Systems inked an agreement to buy Point Grey Research  Inc  for about  253 million  Point Grey develops machine vision cameras used in industrial automation systems  medical diagnostic equipment  intelligent traffic systems  people counting systems  military and defense products  and advanced mapping systems  The addition of Point Grey s capabilities will add to FLIR Systems  OEM cores and components business  and expand its range of visible spectrum machine vision cameras and solutions  This can translate into bright prospects as machine vision and retail people counting are attractive end markets and represent somewhat underpenetrated application spaces for thermal imaging technology 
We believe that the company has numerous strengths to build upon  coupled with great growth prospects  which will help it tide over short term headwinds 
Stocks to Consider

2868,224383,CRAI,5 Top Business Services Stocks To Buy As Job Gains Rebound ,opinion,"In March  job additions recovered significantly from a slump encountered in the preceding month  Hiring breezed past estimates  allaying fears that an economic slump was in the works  While some areas of weakness were clearly visible  healthcare and professional and technical services emerged as the leading recruiters With the year s sluggish start behind us  investors can now focus on the positive aspects of the U S  economy  Expansion is indeed taking place at a slower rate and the pace of hiring has also declined But wages continue to rise even as unemployment remains flat at a record low  Investing in business services stocks  among the top hiring sectors in March  looks prudent now Hiring Recovers  Unemployment Flat at 50 Year LowThe U S  economy added 196 000 jobs in March  easily exceeding the consensus estimate of 184 000  February s dismal hiring numbers were revised upward from 20 000 to 33 000  January s job gains were also revised marginally upward to 312 000  These revisions took the first quarter s average job gains to a solid 180 000 The rebound in hiring ensured that the unemployment rate for March was unchanged at a 50 year low of 3 8   The U6 unemployment rate  which includes people forced into part time work and those only sporadically looking for jobs  also remained flat at 7 3   This represents a marginal decline from the year ago level of 7 9  Meanwhile  average hourly earnings increased 4 cents to  27 70  The year over year increase in earnings declined from 3 4  to 3 2   But even then  wages continue to increase at their fastest pace in a decade A large swathe of economists thinks yearly wage gains will hit 4  in the near term  This clearly serves to illustrate how tight hiring conditions are at the moment Healthcare  White Collar Firms Lead HiringMarch s gains were largely broad based  Food services and drinking places added 27 000 jobs  in keeping with their average gains over the past 12 months  Employment in construction remained flat at 16 000 However  the sector has added 246 000 jobs over the past 12 months  In February  builders were forced to reduce hiring by the most in 18 months due to extremely cold weather Healthcare  and professional and technical services led jobs gains  Employment in healthcare increased by 49 000 jobs in March and nearly 400 000 in the past 12 months  Professional and technical services added 34 000 jobs last month  The sector has created 311 000 jobs over the past 12 months Last month  employment in computer systems design and related services increased by 12 000  Management and technical consulting services and architectural and engineering services added 6 000 jobs each Our ChoicesMarch s jobs report will go a long way in restoring confidence in the U S  economy  Retail sales and housing data weighed on consumer sentiment recently  though the former metric has registered a revival  Economic conditions look favorable once again and are likely to be aided by the Fed s dovish stance This is why it makes good sense to add business services stocks to your portfolio  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks  each of which has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and good VGM Score  You can see  Clean Harbors  Inc    NYSE CLH   is a leading

2871,224386,ARTX,Beyond Tesla  2 Lithium Stocks To Buy Now,opinion,"While the market for Lithium ion  Li ion  batteries has a ton of untapped potential  Tesla Motors Inc  s   NASDAQ TSLA   decision to build a  to meet its requirement of lithium ion battery packs brought glaring focus on the shortage of supply of this emerging energy storage technology 
Li ion batteries are a type of rechargeable battery in which lithium ions move from the anode to cathode during discharge  and from cathode to anode when charging  They are a popular choice be electric car manufacturers  and are used by General Motors Co    NYSE GM    Navistar International Corp    NYSE NAV    BMW AG   NYSE F    Daimler AG   NYSE F    and Ford Motor Co    NYSE F    among many others  Li ion batteries are also used in cellphones  laptops  and other electronic devices as well as in the aerospace and defense sector 
Back in January  it was reported that Panasonic Corp    NYSE F    in Tesla s Gigafactory  Kazuhiro Tsuga  President of Panasonic  said that  We are sort of waiting on the demand from Tesla  If Tesla succeeds and the electric vehicle becomes mainstream  the world will be changed and we will have lots of opportunity to grow  
By 2020  Tesla expects the annual Li ion battery production of the Gigafactory to exceed the global production in 2013  The factory will produce enough battery packs to allow Tesla to build around 500 000 electric cars annually by 2020 
However  Tesla s Gigafactory will not start production until at least 2017  Until then  the focus will be on other Li ion battery manufacturers  Thus  it would be a good idea to invest in some companies that manufacture these batteries 
Let s take a look at two stocks that are looking good at the moment 
1  Arotech Corp    NASDAQ ARTX   has two business divisions  Training and Simulation  and Battery and Power Systems  The Battery and Power Systems division manufactures and sells Lithium and Zinc Air batteries and smart chargers for the military and to the private defense industry in the Middle East  Europe  and Asia

2872,224387,ARTX,4 Defense Stocks To Buy On Trump Victory,opinion,"In what can arguably be called the most startling electoral outcome in modern American history  Donald Trump s victory last week led to an initial meltdown only to bounce back strong later    extinguishing pre market fears of global sell offs  No doubt  the unexpected rally in the market was as surprising as the victory itself 
Coming to the Aerospace and Defense sector  the Trump win has been cheered by the stocks in this space  This is reflected by the 7  gain by both the S P 500 Aerospace   Defense  Industry  Index and the Dow Jones U S  Aerospace   Defense Index while the S P 500 climbed only 1 1  in the Nov 9 11 period 
In fact  the promises of greater spending and expansion of troops that Trump had made in his pre electoral campaign have won over defense majors  However  at the same time  Trump had hinted at a cutback in defense spending  particularly in Japan and South Korea  which played spoilsport 
Meanwhile  a quick review of the past reveals that the Conservative Republican Party has  in general  advocated in favor of increased military spending 
Considering these bullish factors and the latest request by President Obama for an additional  11 6 billion in supplemental war related funding  reflect a possibility of a higher rally by the defense stocks  in the near future   
Factors Boosting Defense Stocks
Although Trump s victory provided a boost to the defense sector  the intrinsic strength of the stocks in this space is worth a mention  We have discussed a few key points briefly below 
With geopolitical uncertainty on the rise  developed as well as emerging nations have increased their defense spending manifold in the last decade  The crisis has been particularly felt with the meteoric rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria  ISIS  Obviously  the direct beneficiaries of such global crisis are the aerospace and defense majors of the U S    the most successful ones in the world 
Moreover  demand for more fuel efficient aircraft  a growing international market and increasing application of unmanned aircraft in warfare today have driven sales in these sectors 
Also  low interest rate in the U S  for the past few quarters has also been favoring the defense stocks  which need substantial funding for the production of aircraft and defense equipment 
With the U S  fiscal 2016 bill emphasizing on cyber programs  cyber oriented work is expected to yield solid growth  Consequently  defense biggies like Raytheon Company   NYSE RTN   which develop various cybersecurity and special mission programs will be benefitted 
Apart from these factors  the landmark  38 billion deal that the U S  signed with Israel in Sep 2016 for 10 years reflects a crucial decision on the nation s part to substantially boost its defense sector  Per the terms of the contract  Israel has to spend as much as  1 2 billion of the  3 8 billion allotted to it per year on the advanced military equipment that only the U S  can provide 
Among other defense primes  The Boeing Company   NYSE BA   and Lockheed Martin Corp    NYSE LMT   are expected to gain the most from the deal  Per this deal  Israel will receive Lockheed s 33 F 35 jets and Boeing s 10 F 15 aircraft 
4 Stocks to Pick
With the factors working in favor of the defense sector  it is time investors consider a few top performing stocks from this space   We have picked four defense stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   which have experienced a share price hike of more than 4  in last five trading sessions  compared to the S P 500 Index s 3 6  over the same time frame

2873,224388,ARTX,TransDigm  TDG  Q4 Earnings Beat  Revenues Improve Y Y,opinion,"After a strong beat last quarter  TransDigm Group Incorporated   NYSE TDG   followed up with another beat in its fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results 
The aircraft supplier posted adjusted quarterly earnings  including stock based compensation adjustments  of  3 10 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 07 
The figures fared even better in year over year comparison  registering an increase of almost 13 6  from the year ago tally of  2 83 per share 
For fiscal 2016  the company s adjusted earnings per share were up 27 5  to  11 49  
Net income for the quarter came in at  154 7 million  up 9 2  from the comparable quarter a year ago  The increase in income was driven primarily by growth in net sales  robust operating margin resulting from the strength of proprietary products  continued gains from productivity efforts and favorable product mix  Also  lower effective tax rate proved conducive to the net income growth 
Inside the Headlines
Net sales for the quarter came in at  875 2 million  representing year over year growth of 8 1   However  the top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  880 million 
The quarterly top line growth mainly came on the back of solid contribution from previously completed acquisitions namely  PneuDraulics  Breeze Eastern and Data Device Corporation  These acquisitions contributed  88 6 million to the sales 
Sturdy growth in commercial aftermarket revenues  up about 6 5  from the prior year  boosted revenues  While commercial OEM sales remained flat  Defense revenues grew 2  over the comparable period last year 
For fiscal 2016  the company s net sales came in at  3 171 4 million  up an impressive 17 2  compared with the year ago tally  This growth largely came on the back of strategic acquisitions 
TransDigm s EBITDA  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  escalated 16 6  year over year to  423 3 million  driven by robust sales 
Acquisitions
During the reported quarter  Transdigm Group closed the buyout of Young   Franklin Inc  and its subsidiaries  including Tactair Fluid Controls Inc  The deal will expand its footprint in the market of highly engineered  proprietary products  with significant aftermarket content  The Liverpool  NY based Young   Franklin makes highly engineered valves and actuators  and almost all its products are proprietary 
The acquired business will add to TransDigm s revenues to the extent of about  75 million  for the fiscal year ending Dec 2016  Of this  aftermarket revenues will account about 70  of the total 
The other important buyouts made this year include the  1 billion buyout of ILC Holdings Inc   the parent company of defense firm   Data Device Corporation   DDC     and mission critical electromechanical systems manufacturer   Breeze Eastern Corporation  The ILC Holdings buyout will empower TransDigm fortify its footprint in the market of highly engineered  proprietary products  with significant aftermarket content  while strengthening its presence in the military and commercial aircraft market 
Moreover  the Breeze Eastern Corporation takeover will strengthen the company s foothold in the aerospace industry  especially in the niche markets of highly engineered proprietary aerospace components 
Liquidity
TransDigm ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  1 59 billion  significantly up from  714 million as of Sep 30  2015  At the end of Sep 30  2016  the company s long term debt was  9 94 billion  compared with  8 11 billion at the end of Sep 2015 
Also  the company completed an offering of  1 150 million of term loans that will be maturing in 2023  These proceeds were used to partially fund a special dividend of  24 00 per share paid in Nov 2016 and to repurchase  500 million of existing 7 50  Senior Subordinated Notes due in 2021 
TRANSDIGM GROUP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 
   Fiscal 2017 Guidance
Concurrent with its fiscal fourth quarter earnings release  TransDigm Group offered its fiscal 2017 guidance  The company projects net sales to be in the range of  3 515  3 565 million  Adjusted earnings are forecast to lie within the range of  11 84  12 12 per share  
Also  TransDigm Group projected net income to lie in the band of  577  593 million and EBITDA to be in the range of  1 671  1 695 million 
As per businesses  the company believes commercial aftermarket revenues to be up between middle to high single digit percentage and commercial OEM revenues to be up in the low to mid single digit percentage range  However  the company anticipates defense revenues to be flat for the fiscal year 
Our Take
TransDigm Group posted impressive fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results  mainly on the back of positive trends in the Commercial Aftermarket business  About 90  of its sales were generated by proprietary products  that is  products for which the company owns the intellectual property  This translates into consistent and sustained revenue generation capacity through all phases of the aerospace cycle 
TransDigm has been actively working toward strengthening and enhancing its position in highly engineered proprietary aerospace components  niche markets  The recent acquisitions made by the company have boosted its proprietary aerospace businesses  supplementing growth  Further  the Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company s efforts to streamline costs will likely translate into solid margin expansion in the quarters ahead 
Other Stocks to Consider
Other favorably placed stocks in the broader sector include Arotech Corp    NASDAQ ARTX    Northrop Grumman Corp    NYSE NOC   and Engility Holdings  Inc    NYSE EGL    All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

2892,224407,CRAI,5 Business Services Stocks To Defy Slump In Job Gains ,opinion,February s job additions  which came in well below expectations  sparked fresh concerns that the U S  economy is slowing  More alarmingly  job gains recorded were the lowest in 17 months  At the same time  the slowdown needs to be taken with a pinch of salt  This is because seasonal fluctuations need to be taken into consideration Job gains for most industries remained largely flat  except construction  which experienced significant job losses  But standing tall was health  and professional and business services Incidentally  professional and business services have contributed the highest number of jobs in the past 12 months  This is why it makes sense to add stocks from this domain to your portfolio Smallest Job Additions in 17 MonthsThe U S  economy added merely 20 000 jobs in February  well below the consensus estimate of 186 000 jobs  This  in itself  is far less than January s upwardly revised figure of 311 000  Further  this is the lowest number of jobs that the U S  economy has added since September 2017 To put things in perspective  the economy has been adding an average number of 200 000 jobs over the past year  So despite February s slump  the rate of hiring remains firm enough to push unemployment lower This was visible in February when the unemployment rate declined from 4  to 3 8   The primary reason for this is that government workers rejoined the workforce at the end of the partial government shutdown Business Services Contributes Maximum JobsConstruction was a major casualty of such a weak report  recording 31 000 job losses during the month  This partially negates the addition of 53 000 jobs in January  Heavy and civil engineering construction lost 13 000 jobs  Wholesale trade contributed 11 000 jobs  while manufacturing added a paltry 4 000 Job additions for the other major industries such as leisure and hospitality  retail trade  mining  transportation and warehousing remained largely flat  Healthcare was one of the few industries to make a major contribution  adding 21 000 jobs But leading the pack once again in February was professional and business services with 42 000 job additions  This is more or less in keeping with its average monthly contribution over the past 12 months  This implies that the industry is still the leader as far as job gains over the past year are concerned Our ChoicesAccording to most economists  one poor jobs report should not be a cause for concern  Of course  fears of an economic slowdown could flare up  But it pays to keep in mind that unexpected fluctuations are par for the course since the cessation of the government shutdown Overall professional and business services have provided the highest number of job additions over the past 12 months  Adding stocks from this industry looks like a smart choice at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners

International Inc    NYSE RHI    Insperity  Inc   NSP  and Clean Harbors  Inc    NYSE CLH    Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  5 Business Services Stocks to Defy Slump in Job GainsFebruary s job additions  which came in well below expectations  sparked fresh concerns that the U S  economy is slowing  More alarmingly  job gains recorded were the lowest in 17 months  At the same time  the slowdown needs to be taken with a pinch of salt  This is because seasonal fluctuations need to be taken into consideration Job gains for most industries remained largely flat  except construction  which experienced significant job losses  But standing tall was health  and professional and business services Incidentally  professional and business services have contributed the highest number of jobs in the past 12 months  This is why it makes sense to add stocks from this domain to your portfolio Smallest Job Additions in 17 MonthsThe U S  economy added merely 20 000 jobs in February  well below the consensus estimate of 186 000 jobs  This  in itself  is far less than January s upwardly revised figure of 311 000  Further  this is the lowest number of jobs that the U S  economy has added since September 2017 To put things in perspective  the economy has been adding an average number of 200 000 jobs over the past year  So despite February s slump  the rate of hiring remains firm enough to push unemployment lower This was visible in February when the unemployment rate declined from 4  to 3 8   The primary reason for this is that government workers rejoined the workforce at the end of the partial government shutdown Business Services Contributes Maximum JobsConstruction was a major casualty of such a weak report  recording 31 000 job losses during the month  This partially negates the addition of 53 000 jobs in January  Heavy and civil engineering construction lost 13 000 jobs  Wholesale trade contributed 11 000 jobs  while manufacturing added a paltry 4 000 Job additions for the other major industries such as leisure and hospitality  retail trade  mining  transportation and warehousing remained largely flat  Healthcare was one of the few industries to make a major contribution  adding 21 000 jobs But leading the pack once again in February was professional and business services with 42 000 job additions  This is more or less in keeping with its average monthly contribution over the past 12 months  This implies that the industry is still the leader as far as job gains over the past year are concerned Our ChoicesAccording to most economists  one poor jobs report should not be a cause for concern  Of course  fears of an economic slowdown could flare up  But it pays to keep in mind that unexpected fluctuations are par for the course since the cessation of the government shutdown Overall professional and business services have provided the highest number of job additions over the past 12 months  Adding stocks from this industry looks like a smart choice at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a

Services PicksIn October  the unemployment rate remained flat at a 49 year low  However  job additions widely exceeded expectations  indicating that the economy remains robust late into the expansion  The spurt in job gains came after a disappointing September  during which fierce storms impeded job gains  However  job additions for August were revised significantly upward Meanwhile  wage gains exceeded 3  for the first time since the Great Recession ended in the middle of 2009  Job gains were led by healthcare  manufacturing and transportation and warehousing  However  professional and business services have contributed the largest number of jobs over the past year  This is why it makes sense to add stocks from this domain to your portfolio Unemployment Flat at 49 Year LowThough job additions for October widely exceeded expectations  the unemployment rate remained flat at 3 7   the lowest since December 1969  The U6 unemployment rate  which includes people forced into part time work and people only sporadically looking for jobs  declined from 7 5  to 7 4  Additionally  the number of employed individuals increased to a record level of 156 6 million  The employment population ratio increased by 0 2  to 60 6   its highest level since December 2008  Also  the labor force participation rate increased by 0 2  to 62 9  Notably  the increase in the labor force participation rate was not accompanied by a jump in the number of unemployed persons  which remained flat at 6 1 million  The number of individuals not considered to be part of the labor force declined by 487 000 to 95 9 million Professional and Business Services Post Highest Yearly GainsThe economy added 250 000 jobs in October  significantly higher than the consensus estimate of 193 000  Over the last 12 months  the economy has added 211 000 jobs per month on average  These gains have come despite indications from several quarters that the economy is near full employment In September  job gains plummeted  primarily due to the effect of fierce storms such as Hurricane Florence  The figure was revised further downward from 134 000 to 118 000  However  this was totally offset by the upward revision in the August figure  which has been increased from 270 000 to 286 000 At the forefront of job gains were healthcare  manufacturing  construction and transportation and warehousing  which added 36 000  32 000  30 000 and 25 000 jobs  respectively Professional and business services added 35 000 jobs  Notably  the industry has added 516 000 jobs over the past year  the highest among all those covered by the report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Our ChoicesThe significant improvement in job additions for October indicates that the economy remains robust even at such a late point in the expansion  The unemployment rate remains flat at a record low even as the labor force participation rate inches up Overall professional and business services have provided the highest number of job additions

2898,224413,CRAI,5 Top Ranked Small Cap Stocks To Escape Trade Tension,opinion,Wall Street has seen a nasty spell of trading over the past several months  pulling the major indices down for the year  This is because global trade worries  threats of inflation  concerns over speedy tightening of monetary policy  and the ongoing political turmoil in Washington continued to provide resistance On the other hand  macro fundamentals paint a rosy picture given that the U S  economy has entered its second longest expansion since 1785  This is especially thanks to higher consumer spending  rising consumer confidence  low borrowing cost  growing wages  and solid hiring  In particular  consumers were more confident in April  with the consumer confidence index rebounding to an 18 year high  indicating solid economic growth prospects Additionally  President Donald Trump is betting on juicy growth through  1 5 trillion in tax cuts and fresh government spending  If this wasn t enough  strong earnings expectation will provide further lift to the stocks Against such a backdrop  small cap stocks could be an excellent choice for investors seeking a top pick in today s market environment Why Small Caps Small caps are closely tied to the U S  economy and do not have much exposure to the international market  These stocks generally lead the market when the American economy is on a solid footing Small cap stocks are the biggest beneficiaries of the tax cut as these pay higher taxes with a median effective tax rate of 31 9   In comparison  the larger  multi national companies on the S P 500 pay a lower median effective tax rate of 28   while the tax rate for 30 mega cap stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average is even low at 23 8  The pint sized stocks are considered safe and better plays if any political issue or economic turmoil creeps into the picture  As such  these could well insulate investors from any trade woes  in particular U S  China trade dispute or NAFTA negotiations  Further  these stocks are poised to benefit from the strength in the greenback  the trend is being seen lately due to rising yields Since these companies are small  they are poised to grow more than their already tapped out large cap counterparts  However  they are extremely volatile and could lead to huge losses compared with large and mid cap counterparts in a short span How to Play As a result  we have chosen those small caps stock that have a top Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Growth Score of A  solid Industry Rank in the top 40   positive earnings estimate

2900,224415,CRAI,Unemployment Falls To Near 18 Year Low  6 Winning Picks,opinion,In April  the unemployment rate declined to the lowest level witnessed since December 2000  Further  economists indicated that the rate of hiring would likely decline further in the months ahead  Job additions also increased compared to March  though it remained clear that the pace of hiring was undergoing a decline Such a phenomenon is in keeping with a labor market near full employment  Professional and business services led job gains  followed by healthcare and manufacturing  With jobs gains likely to continue in the months ahead  picking stocks from these sectors looks like a prudent option at this point Unemployment Falls to Near 18 Year Low The unemployment rate declined from 4 1  in March to 3 9  in April  the lowest level in nearly 18 years  This pace is also marginally higher than the Federal Reserve s targeted rate of 3 8   This is the first time in six months that the unemployment rate has undergone a decline Incidentally  joblessness has fallen below 4  on very few occasions in the last 70 years  This occurred during the Korean War  the Vietnam War and the dotcom boom in the late sixties  early seventies and in 2000  respectively  In contrast  unemployment had hit 10  in October 2009 when the U S  economy was still recovering from the Great Recession   A section of economists feels that the decline in the unemployment rate was partially attributable to a marginal fall in the labor participation rate  which declined from 62 9  to 62 8   However  most economists expect that the unemployment rate will undergo further declines  Currently  the labor market is increasingly tightening and the Fed has projected a jobless rate of 3 6  for 2019  Professional and Business Services Lead GainsThe economy added 164 000 jobs in April  lower than the consensus estimate of 194 000  However  job additions for March were revised upward from 103 000 to 135 000  During 2018  job additions have registered an average pace of 200 000 jobs per month  higher than last year s average pace of 182 000 At the forefront of job gains were healthcare and manufacturing  Each of these sectors added 24 000 jobs  In the last 12 months  these sectors have added 305 000 and 245 000 jobs  respectively  However  leading the pack was the professional and business services sector which added 54 000 jobs  The sector has added 518 000 jobs in the last 12 months Our ChoicesThe decline in the unemployment rate indicates the extent to which the labor market has tightened  This is also probably why job additions have declined to a pace lower than those witnessed early this year  However  most economists think job additions will continue and the unemployment rate will decline further Professional and business services  healthcare and manufacturing have been the biggest gainers according to the April jobs report  Adding stocks from these sectors looks like a smart choice at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while

job additions for August were revised significantly upward Meanwhile  wage gains exceeded 3  for the first time since the Great Recession ended in the middle of 2009  Job gains were led by healthcare  manufacturing and transportation and warehousing  However  professional and business services have contributed the largest number of jobs over the past year  This is why it makes sense to add stocks from this domain to your portfolio Unemployment Flat at 49 Year LowThough job additions for October widely exceeded expectations  the unemployment rate remained flat at 3 7   the lowest since December

significantly higher than the consensus estimate of 193 000  Over the last 12 months  the economy has added 211 000 jobs per month on average  These gains have come despite indications from several

Strong International Business   CDG Acquisition are Key Growth Drivers
The company s ability to bring together damage assessment  accounting  economics  statistics and finance industries under a single umbrella makes it an excellent partner for global clients dealing with international arbitration issues  Further  FTI Consulting continues to pursue opportunities in other areas like   business transformation services  transaction advisory business  retail  construction  data and analytics  cyber business  information governance and international arbitration 
This  in turn  leads to continued revenue growth  We believe FTI Consulting s international expansion remains strong and is likely to continue in the future as well 
Increased regulatory scrutiny and a proliferation of corporate litigation are also likely to raise the demand for the company s products  Additionally  structural change has become a necessity in the rapidly evolving global markets as management teams look to fend off rivals  protect intellectual property rights and transform businesses via M A  divestiture and other restructuring activities  These developments call for FTI Consulting s specialized skill sets and are likely to boost its revenues

2948,224463,CRAI,5 Top Stocks To Make The Most Of March Madness,opinion,March Madness grips the market again  Ardent fans are gearing up to cheer their favorite basketball team and brackets are made  The annual National Collegiate Athletic Association  NCAA  tournament is quite a challenge for sports analysts when it comes to predicting the winner  Picking the right stocks is equally dicey as investors might either win big or lose all The frenzy of the March Madness hits all  compelling investors to keep an eye on stock market movements  In fact  historically  March Madness tournaments mostly concur with strong stock gains We are also in the middle of a nine year bull run that is backed by business friendly tax cut policies and solid economic growth at home and abroad  Investors have also breathed a sigh of relief after the recent trade war fears on Trump s tariffs plan somewhat eased  while the current ouster of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is nothing but a temporary blip As the broader trend remains positive  it will be prudent to bet on fundamentally sound companies that could make the most of the March Madness March Madness Keeps Sports   Market Analysts on ToesMost of the Americans will agree that March Madness is an electrifying phenomenon that dominates national sports starting the second week of March through the first week of April  March Madness is basically a name given to the NCAA men s and women s basketball tournaments  which determines the national champions of college basketball  Around 68 men s teams and 64 women s teams will be participating  This tournament is so popular that more number of Americans are expected to fill the tournament bracket than those who have voted for President Trump last year March Madness  of course  is a huge revenue generator for the NCAA  As per the American Gaming Association  Americans are expected to gamble a staggering  10 billion on the tournament this year  which almost matches the GDP of countries like Armenia  Malta and Namibia  Most of the bets  however  will happen under the table  Only 3  of the betting is expected to be legal Predicting the tournament is so hard that billionaire Warren Buffett is willing to offer an astronomical prize to any employee who can pick all Sweet 16 teams  The employee will be given a sum of  1 million per year for the rest of his or her life   Thus  the human reasoning used in the tournament s decision making process has many comparisons to that of investing in the stock market  Like sports analysts who seem confident enough to pick the winning team from the NCAA tournament  market pundits claim that they can pick the stocks that will outdo the broader market  In fact  the NCAA tournament  historically  have put Wall Street in a buying mood March Madness Concurs With Solid Stock GainsThe U S  stock market posted encouraging results in the last March Madness  The Dow Jones Industrials Average has risen in nine of the past 12 times  while the S P 500 rallied in 10 of the trailing 12 tournaments  Lest we forget  March rings in more positive returns for the S P 500  The average monthly return in March from 2007 to 2016 has been 2 7   the best monthly performance in a year on an average return basis The tech laden Nasdaq Composite Index has also been up in nine of the past 12 tournaments  while the Russell 2000 index  that represents the smaller companies in the U S  stock market  went up in nine of the past 12 years  To top it  the tournament enters the month of April  which is traditionally the second best performing month of the year      Bull Market Turns 9  Investors Cheer Global Economic GrowthThe broader markets  in the meantime  have scaled new highs on the latest Republican tax cuts and robust economic growth at home and abroad  On Mar 9  the U S  stock market celebrated its ninth anniversary of the bull run Trump s polices including tax cuts  repealing regulations and increased infrastructure outlays restored expectations of a pro growth agenda that helped the broader market push further into record territory Trump s economy also started 2017 on a stellar note  The U S  economy expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 3  last year  marking the best growth in two years  Also  Americans are getting fatter paychecks  with wages growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decadeBut  there is another major factor behind the strong American growth  It s the global economic growth  with every major country from China to Europe and Latin America to Japan expanding at a healthy pace  According to the International Monetary Fund  the global economy expanded at a rate of 3 7  last year  the fastest since 2010 March Madness Puts Wall Street on a Buying Spree  5 GainersLike sports analysts are betting on winners from the NCAA tournament  investors are looking for stocks that are likely to scale higher  Hence  it makes sense to invest in some rock solid stocks that could make the most of the market bullishness For that to happen  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks will be the best choice  The stocks also boost a  of A  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth

2949,224464,CRAI,5 Top Ranked Small Cap Stocks To Ride Out Trade War Fears,opinion,Last week  U S  equities suffered their gravest losses in more than two years  Fears of an impending trade war between the United States and China crippled markets  with the Dow suffering its worst week weekly loss since January 2016  These losses underscore the challenges faced by large cap stocks in recent times  a trend that is likely to continue In fact  small cap stocks have posted better performances compared to their larger counterparts over most of this month  Investors have sought out smaller companies for two reasons  First  they are likely to remain relatively insulated from the impact of a trade war  Second  they are expected to benefit appreciably from recent tax cuts  This is why it makes sense to invest in select small cap stocks at this point Small Caps Outperform Larger CounterpartsSince the end of February  the Dow and the S P 500 have lost around 6  and 4 6   respectively  In contrast  the small cap heavy Russell 2000 index has edged 0 2  down  This indicates that investors are keen to snap up small caps for their tax cuts and trade war related advantages Such a tendency has also gained favor among the investing community because large manufacturers are bound to experience a profits squeeze as Trump s steel and aluminum tariffs raise input costs  Further  retaliation from China and the European Commission could weigh on the bottom lines of large companies with multinational operations In such an event  small cap stocks look to be relatively better investments  This is because most of them are domestically focused with negligible foreign exposure  This enables them to gain from recent tax reductions while protecting them from the fallout of a potential trade war Replay of Post Election Surge and Fall Likely One section of investors feels that the current scenario is nearly identical to the situation prevailing immediately after Trump s victory in November 2016  At that time  small cap shares had experienced a tremendous upsurge  buoyed by speculation surrounding tax cuts and protectionist measures As a result  between Election Day and the end of 2016  the Russell 2000 gained 14   easily outperforming the S P 500 s 4 6  increase  Subsequently  however  gains for small caps faded as doubts arose over the Trump administration s ability to implement the President s electoral promises As of now  the overall economic outlook continues to be bright  But the situation could change drastically if a trade war really does happen  With both the Dow and the S P 500 posting their worst weekly losses in more than two years  investors likely feel that such a nightmare may indeed come true  Given this backdrop  it is unlikely that the popularity of small caps will decline in the near term Our ChoicesBlue chip stocks have recently received a hammering at the bourses  This is primarily due to concerns that a trade war could soon break out between the United States and China  Small caps have emerged as relatively safe bets in this scenario  Not only do they stand to gain the most from tax cuts  they are also relatively insulated from the fallout of a trade war Adding small cap stocks to your portfolios looks like a particularly smart option at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have narrowed down our search to the

2952,224467,DXLG,Wal Mart To Name China Head As CEO Of Its UK Chain ASDA,opinion,"In order to save its struggling U K  division Asda  Wal Mart Stores Inc    NYSE WMT   is reportedly planning to appoint China head Sean Clarke as the Chief Executive Officer   CEO   of Asda this week  Clarke will take over the new position on Jul 11 
Clarke will replace Andy Clarke  who had said in an earlier Retail Week interview that Roger Burnley from rival Sainsbury Plc will serve as the Chief Operating Officer of Asda  Burnley will take up this role in October  Andy Clarke  who has served Asda for 20 long years  will take up an advisory role to the retailer for the remainder of 2016 
We note that Asda s underlying sales performance has declined since the past seven quarters amid a price war with other discounters that has squeezed its profits  The expansion of these discounters also took away Asda s position of U K  s cheapest mainstream grocer 
The CEO of Wal Mart s international unit has entrusted Clarke with a big responsibility  given his experience and expects him to turn around Asda s results  He has worked for retailers in Japan  Canada  and most recently  China WAL MART STORES Price and Consensus   Wal Mart operates more than 11 500 retail units under 72 different banners in 28 countries and e commerce websites in 11 countries  Wal Mart s stores offer almost everything which is of day to day use  enabling it to keep the number one spot  on the basis of revenues  on the Fortune 500 list for the fourth year in a row 
However  we note that the Bentonville  AR based company is facing severe challenges and has been showing signs of acute weakness since the past few quarters  While increased investments in technology in order to compete with Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   and an increase in pay for its workers are helping to boost sales of this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company  it is also increasing its expense burden 
The retail giant is making efforts to understand the evolving needs of its customers to regain their confidence  and thus boost sales  However  higher labor costs along with the company s efforts to overhaul its stores and invest in its online operations will weigh on its earnings in the near term

2973,224488,CRAI,Looking For A Top Value Stock  3 Reasons Why CRA International  CRAI  Is An Excellent Choice,opinion,Many investors like to look for value in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for value investors in the near term This method discovered several great candidates for value oriented investors  but today let s focus on CRA International Inc    NASDAQ CRAI   as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous reasons why this is the case  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for CRAI s status as a solid value stock below Price to Forward Sales for CRA InternationalOne of the most underrated ratios for value investors is the price forward sales metric  This ratio shows investors how much they are paying for each dollar of revenues generated  In other words  a lower number is better here while a price to sales ratio of 1 means that you are paying one dollar for each dollar in sales With a P S ratio of 0 8  CRAI investors are paying 80 cents in stock price for each dollar of revenue generated by the company  Compare this to the industry average of 1 33  and it is safe to say that CRAI is undervalued compared to many of its peers on this important metric CRA INTL INC PS Ratio  TTM     Price Cash Flow for CRA International StockAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This reading is preferred by some since it avoids amortization and depreciation concerns and can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business The P CF ratio for CRAI comes in at 9 19  and since investors are generally looking for a reading under 20 here  this is pretty good news  Meanwhile  we should also point out that the industry average for this metric is 11 04  so CRA International has its peers beat in this regard too CRAI Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionThe solid value ratios outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  but we should also note that the earnings estimate revisions have been trending in a positive direction as well  Analysts who follow CRAI stock have been raising their estimates for the company lately  meaning that the EPS picture is looking a bit more favorably for CRA International now Over the past 30 days  1 earnings estimate has gone higher compared to none lower for the full year  while we are also seeing that 1 estimate has move upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame too   These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as 30 days ago CRAI was expected to post earnings of  1 23 per share for the full year though today it looks to have EPS of  1 30 for the full year  Bottom LineFor the reasons detailed above  investors shouldn t be surprised to read that we have CRAI as a stock with a Value Score of  A  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  So if you are a value investor  definitely keep CRAI on your short list as this looks to be a stock that is very well positioned for gains in the near term  Zacks  Top Investment Ideas for Long Term ProfitHow would you like to see our best recommendations to help you find today s most promising long term stocks  Starting now  you can look inside our portfolios featuring stocks under  10  income stocks  value investments and more  These picks  which have double and triple digit profit potential  are rarely available to the public  But you can see them now ,2016-11-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/looking-for-a-top-value-stock-3-reasons-why-cra-international-(crai)-is-an-excellent-choice-200165265,200165265

Rogers Corporation  NYSE    NYSE ROG       Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Invest in These 5 Momentum Stocks Using Driehaus StrategyInvestors with a strong risk appetite usually target momentum stocks for attractive returns  In this context  Driehaus Strategy could be used  which Richard Driehaus formulated using the  buy high and sell higher  principle  The success of this investing strategy earned Driehaus a place in Barron s All Century Team The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed following the strategy  returned 13 5  and 18 1  in the five  and 10 year time frames  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  returns registered by the S P 500  Thus investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns A Detailed Look into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy  Driehaus once said   I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   In line with this insight  AAII took into account the percentage 50 day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus  philosophy It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included in this strategy  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend Moreover  AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers  Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy  which was made to provide better returns over the long term Screening ParametersIn order to make the strategy more profitable  we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and a Momentum Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a  of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential   Zacks Rank equal to  1 Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see     Last 5 year average EPS growth rates above 2  Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business   Trailing 12 month EPS growth higher than 0 and industry median Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks   Last four quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5  Positive EPS surprise indicates potential   Positive   50 day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks High   50 day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend   Momentum Score equal to or less than B Favorable momentum score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success These few parameters have narrowed down the universe of

3004,224519,CLMT,Can Rising Shale Output Disrupt Oil s Rally  6 Top Picks ,opinion,On May 27  oil prices increased more than 1  boosted by geopolitical tensions and the impact of OPEC s production controls  Only last week  crude prices had suffered their worst weekly losses of the year due to trade tensions and concerns about global growth A new report from Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   states that deflationary factors will keep oil prices low in the long term  The report does acknowledge the impact of supply bottlenecks and geopolitical concerns that have cropped up this year  However  it says that rising U S  shale supplies will dampen any rise in crude prices But the report has a long list of conditions which would have to hold true if crude prices are to remain depressed even in the long term  With geopolitical tensions likely to persist  investing in oil stocks looks like a smart option Geopolitical Tensions  Supply Bottlenecks Boost PricesThis has been a particularly good year for crude prices  with WTI crude gaining nearly  15 since the start of 2019  This is primarily due to tight supplies  which in turn is attributable to three different sources First  U S  sanctions have led to a considerable decline in exports from Iran  taking a significant amount of supply off the markets  OPEC s output controls continue to support prices and are likely to remain in place for the entire year Another factor boosting prices is the disruption in supplies from Russia  The country s crude output has continued to decline in May  per Reuters  This is attributable to a reduction in exports following the detection of contaminated shipments to Europe in April Can Rising Shale Output Cap Gains However  Morgan Stanley thinks that the success of U S  shale producers will cap price gains in the longer term  Its freshly released report does agree that growth in output is declining  However  the report suggests that volumes could still increase considerably in the future  Shale producers are using digitization  automation and robotics to slowly but surely boost their output levels Further  since shale oil is an abundant resource  costs should decline as the associated technology improves  This in turn could lead cartels like OPEC to cut prices as well in order to effectively compete with their U S  counterparts But the report takes a rather long term view and is overly optimistic about shale prospects  per market watchers  They point to the fact that breakeven levels have remained unchanged despite the cost savings incurred from the improvement in technology Per a report from the Post Carbon Institute  intensive drilling and increases in capacity have only front loaded production  leaving actual output relatively the same  Even Morgan Stanley s report assumes that the E P industry will overcome most operational obstacles  acknowledging that inability to do so would prevent production from reaching its true potential Our ChoicesThe success of U S  shale has led several leading agencies to predict that crude prices could remain soft in the longer term  However  such an outcome is subject to several caveats  All of these assume that the industry will be able to overcome operational bottlenecks quickly and easily Meanwhile  the geopolitical tensions and supply bottlenecks which propelled crude higher this year remain very much in place  This is why it makes good sense to add oil stocks to your portfolio  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that

3009,224524,CIDM,Cinedigm Stock  Gaining Big On Q4 Earnings,opinion,"Cinedigm Corp  NASDAQ CIDM 
Ciedigm is having an incredible day in the market today  and for good reason  The company reported its earnings for the fourth quarter  beating expectations and exciting investors  Today  we ll talk about what we saw from the earnings report  how the market reacted to the news  and what we can expect to see from CIDM moving forward  So  let s get right to it 
CIDM Reports Strong Earnings
As mentioned above  Cinedigm is having an incredibly strong trading session today  and for good reason  The company released its earnings report yesterday after the closing bell  along with key updates  Here s what we saw from the report 
Earnings   In terms of earnings CIDM did incredibly well  During the quarter  analysts expected that the company would report earnings in the amount of  1 05 per share  However  the company surprised investors by reporting a far narrower loss than expected  In the first quarter  the content distributor produced a loss of  0 95 per share   0 10 ahead of analyst expectations 
Revenue   While revenue wasn t quite as strong as earnings  CIDM definitely didn t disappoint either  During the quarter  the company generated revenue in the amount of  23 21 million  This figure came in right in line with analyst expectations 
Cost Savings   The year 2016 has been an incredibly important year for Cinedigm  That s because the company launched an initiative early this year with a goal of saving on costs  Along with earnings the company announced that these initiatives are going very successfully  In fact  they are expecting to achieve in excess of  10 million in cost savings this year 
Management Changes   Finally  CIDM made key announcements with regard to management  First and foremost  Ron Chez has been appointed as the new lead director of the company  He has served as a strategic advisor to the company for the past year  Also  effective immediately  the company s board of directors will be reduced from seven members to five members  It was announced that Blair Westlake and Martin O Connor have made the decision to resign from the board in order to achieve this reduction  In a statement with regard to management changes  CEO Chris McGurk had the following to offer 
 This streamlining will further improve board efficiency and I am confident the board is fully aligned with shareholder interest  
How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  one of the first things that we learn is that the news moves the market  Any time positive news is released with regard to a publicly traded company  we can expect to see gains in the stock associated with the news  Adversely  when negative news is released  we can expect to see declines  In this particular case  the news that was released with regard o CIDM was overwhelmingly positive  As a result  the stock had a strong day in the market today  By the end of the trading session  the stock closed the day off at  1 59 per share after a gain of  0 69 per share or 77 06  
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have an overwhelmingly bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from Cinedigm  The reality is that the loss being smaller is good news  However  that s not why investors are so happy  The excitement is coming from the fact that the company is doing incredibly well on its cost savings initiatives  On top of that  the management news was overwhelmingly positive  At the moment  it seems as though CIDM is on track for strong gains ahead ",2016-07-17,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cinedigm-(cidm)-stock:-gaining-big-on-q4-earnings-200142233,200142233
3010,224525,CLFD,Zacks com Featured Expert Kevin Matras Highlights  First  Clearfield  BioDelivery Sciences International  MGIC Investment And Kratos Defense   Security Solutions,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   February 28  2019  Stocks in this week s article include First BanCorp    NYSE FBP    Clearfield  Inc    NASDAQ CLFD    BioDelivery Sciences International  Inc    NASDAQ BDSI    MGIC Investment Corp    NYSE MTG   and Kratos Defense   Security Solutions  Inc    NASDAQ KTOS    Kevin Matras screens for companies showing their  first  profit and explains why they are ones to watch Screen of the Week written by Kevin Matras of Zacks Investment Research 5 Affordable Breakout Stocks for Super Returns
Seeking out breakout stocks is probably one of the most favored techniques among active investors  The logic behind this kind of stock selection is to determine which stocks are trading within a narrow band  These stocks are to be bought as soon as they move above this channel and sold when they fall below  In case a stock moves above this band  it usually gains momentum 
At the same time  market watchers warn against incorrectly timing such a move  This is because there is a significant risk of identifying stock movements as breakouts even when this is not the case  However  when utilized judiciously  this strategy yields formidable gains  which is the reason why it remains popular 
Spotting Prospective Candidates
In order to identify breakout stocks  you must first determine their resistance and support levels  A resistance level is the barrier which must be broken so as to be identified as a breakout stock  Meanwhile  a support level is the floor for the stock s movement 
At the breakout level  demand for the stock has peaked  making it a natural choice for traders  On the other hand  when a stock hits the support floor  traders are eager to offload it  In order to spot breakout stocks  you would have to see which of these are on the brink of breaking the resistance barrier or those which have just breached this level 
Checking Whether It s for Real
Stocks that have breached their resistance levels should ideally be in high demand among traders  But the test of whether this is a genuine breakout is when they go on to attain higher prices and the old barrier becomes a new support  This is why it is important to determine whether a long term price trend is about to emerge 
Only a study of long term trends can determine whether the existing trading channel has been breached effectively  This indicates the strength of the support or resistance levels  If you can identify the effective channel for a stock  picking it even at a not so reasonable price would give you significant returns

factor  and cost control to generate better operating results  As a result  we achieved good operating results  with recurring EBITDA margin increasing by 3 7 p p  in relation to 3Q16  Factors of the

cleaner  safer  healthier world  Its products include equipment for maintaining surfaces in industrial  commercial and outdoor environments  detergent free and other sustainable cleaning technologies  and coatings for protecting  repairing and upgrading surfaces  Tennant s global field service network is the most extensive in the industry Recent Earnings DataThe company posted net sales of  262  million which was a record for a third quarter  and net income of  3 6 million   But gross margins fell to 39 9  from 42 6  in the year ago quarter   This decline was due to  continued pressure form field service productivity  manufacturing inefficiencies  and raw material inflation   Further  selling and administrative  S A  expensed increased to  85 7 million  32 7  of sales  from  60 6 million  30 3  of sales from the year ago quarter   This increase in spending offset the companies cost reduction initiatives Decreased GuidanceDuring the earnings report  management decreased guidance for

  The change in guidance is attributed to continued operational challenges within our business  including field service productivity  manufacturing efficiencies  and raw material inflation  which accounted for approximately  0 37 per share  Management s TakeAccording to Chris Killingstad  President and CEO   Our third quarter results reflect slower growth in North America attributed to timing of key strategic account deals  the restructuring of our field service team  continued manufacturing inefficiencies and raw material inflation  matters we continue to address   While we faced some near term setbacks  we are staying the course strategically and positioning Tennant to be operationally stronger than ever before  We are ahead of our acquisition plans for IPC  our core Tennant EMEA

3022,224537,CLMT,MLP Stocks Slide On FERC Ruling  Is There An Opportunity ,opinion,There seems to be no respite for the energy infrastructure master limited partnerships  or MLPs   If the Trump administration s proposed 25  tariff on imported steel were not enough  now midstream network providers have found themselves entangled in an FERC tax ruling  bleeding them even further The benchmark Alerian MLP Index   tracking 40 partnerships   suffered its worst fall in more than two years on Thursday in a sell off sparked by concerns of lower tariffs and cash flows  While selling hit most sector constituents  Plains All American Pipeline L P    NYSE PAA   and Energy Transfer Partners L P    NYSE ETP   were two of the biggest daily percentage decliners The Business of MLPs   Advantages of The StructureMLPs differ from regular stocks in that interests in them are referred to as units and the unitholders  not shareholders  are partners in the business  Importantly  these hybrid entities bring together the tax benefits of a limited partnership with the liquidity of publicly traded securities  The assets that these partnerships own typically   oil and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities MLPs represent an attractive investment option for income focused investors in the current environment  In addition to high yields  MLPs are structured as pass through entities This means that they typically distribute nearly all of their cash flows back to unitholders  The MLPs are not required to pay a corporate income tax as the tax liability of the entity is passed on to its owners  or unitholders  in the form of a cash dividend  distribution   This allows the MLPs to offer very attractive yields to the investors The FERC Tax RulingOn Mar 15  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission   FERC   ruled that the interstate oil and natural gas pipelines owned by MLPs can no longer avail a credit for income taxes they do not pay  Revising its 2005 Policy Statement for Recovery of Income Tax Costs  the federal regulators found that the longstanding income tax allowance in their cost of service fees could lead to double recovery of costs for the asset class who are pass through entities not subject to corporate income taxes The Net Effect of the Policy RevisionLooking ahead  the FERC policy revision signals significant future changes on how the pipeline partnerships will go about treating income taxes in their books of accounts As mentioned above  MLPs  being pass through entities  allocates their pre tax income to unitholders on a proportionate basis  The unitholders are then responsible for paying their own share of the partnership s tax obligation  Therefore  the FERC felt that its 2005 policy on income tax allowance provided the partnerships an unfair benefit  possibly resulting in double recovery of costs and boosting their distributable cash flows FERC s recent tax policy change is aimed at addressing this issue  The regulatory body is expected to issue a formal rulemaking guide  outlining the impact of the removal of income tax allowance on interstate pipeline rates Consequently  partnerships charging cost based rates for interstate transportation service would have to lower customer tariffs to move oil  gas and refined products around the country by the amount of their income tax allowances   substantial in certain cases  A reduction in cost recovery would likely cut into their cash flows Impact on MLPSWhile the FERC ruling is definitely a negative for MLPs  it must be remembered that the move will not affect all partnerships and assets  In particular  the changes are not likely to impact pipeline companies that are structured as  C Corporations   and not as MLPs  like Kinder Morgan  Inc    NYSE KMI   and ONEOK  Inc    NYSE OKE    The federal revision will also not apply to MLPs owning midstream assets that begin and terminate within the same state On the other hand  MLPs with significant  cost of service  exposure and large amounts of interstate pipelines   including Energy Transfer Partners and Spectra Energy  F SEP  Partners   NYSE SEP     look to be in most trouble  The change in income tax policies will result in rate reduction  and therefore lower cash flow for pipelines owned by these MLPs That said  all midstream operators with interstate pipelines will not be equally affected by the FERC ruling on tax allowances  with the impact essentially depending on how they charge rates  For example  pipelines under cost of service rates will be impacted but those subject to market based or negotiated tariffs won t be materially affected What NextThough a number of MLPs came out with press releases claiming negligible or no material impact from the FERC ruling  the tax policy change has gripped the sector with wide ranging concerns and uncertainty  With the new rule expected to be adopted only by 2020  the issue may remain a thorn in the flesh for the foreseeable future Opportunity for Bottom FishingThe speed of Thursday s jaw dropping sell off send MLP investors in a panic  Most of them are still jittery and are waiting for the dust to settle before coming back to the market  In particular  they will be carefully analyzing the partnerships  press releases related to FERC s ruling wherein the companies gradually come out with disclosures associated with cost of service exposure and potential impact to their cash flows However  most analysts saw the broad selling as an overreaction with enough opportunity to wade back in the industry  If you are a savvy investor   meaning you see a buying opportunity when stocks sell off   then it may be time to look at MLPs  One might opt for fundamentally strong names that are not likely to be impacted from the FERC rule change but got unfairly punished when the sector as a whole took a turn lower We have shortlisted two of them   Calumet Specialty Products Partners  L P    NASDAQ CLMT   and Oasis Midstream Partners L P    NYSE OMP     carrying Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Calumet Specialty Products Partners is a major North American producer of high quality  specialty products and fuels  The Indianapolis  IN based partnership makes a significant portion of its money by processing crude oil into lubricating oils  solvents  waxes  and other petroleum products  These activities would experience no impact from the FERC change Oasis Midstream Partners is primarily focused on production gathering and gas processing  The Houston  TX based partnership s tariffs come from its economic interests in gathering pipelines  processing facilities and storage facilities  which will see no material effect from FERC s policy revision More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone  It could become the mother of

3023,224538,CLMT,5 Value Stocks Under  10,opinion," 0     Value Stocks Under  10 2     Stock Screener 4     Tracey s Top Stock Picks 12     Warning Signs  What Happens If A Company Goes Bankrupt  16     Episode Roundup  Podcast Zacks comWelcome to Episode  66 of the Value Investor Podcast
Every week  Tracey Ryniec  the editor of Zacks   shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks 
With many well known growth stocks now trading at over  100 a share  Tracey decided to look for some stocks that you could buy at the opposite end of the spectrum  at under  10 
But she didn t just want low cost stocks  She also wanted them to have value fundamentals  She wanted stocks that were genuinely  cheap  by both share price and fundamentals 
Screening for Stocks Under  10
Tracey ran a screen that included  of course  stocks trading under  10  along with a Price to Sales Ratio  P S  under 1 0  Remember  a P S ratio under 1 0 usually indicates value 
For example  if a company has a P S ratio of 0 3  that means an investor is paying 30 cents for every  1 in sales  A bargain 
Tracey also added a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold   She included  holds  because it is still earnings season and many companies haven t yet reported  which will impact the Zacks Rank  Including holds also will give a wider set of names 
The screen gave her 237 results  but some were penny stocks  Tracey stayed away from those 
What was in the Screen  
Lots of energy names  especially drilling services companies  as well as retailers made the list 
But she narrowed it down to just 5 of them  These stocks are cheap but some of them are extremely out of favor on the Street 
It takes guts to be a value investor 
5 Value Stocks Under  10
1      The Container Store    NYSE TCS    has struggled almost from the first day of its IPO  Shares are down 91  from the 2014 IPO and are now trading under  5  This is one of the most hated retailers on the Street  by investors  But as value investors  that s why we take a look  It is expected to make  0 35 in 2017 and  0 39 in 2018  which is earnings growth of 25  
2     Noodles   Company    NASDAQ NDLS    has been abandoned by investors as shares have sunk 88   It has a P S ratio of just 0 3 but is expected to lose  0 01 this year  That s coming off of a loss of  0 17 in 2016  Watch its upcoming earnings report 
3     The Manitowoc Company    NYSE MTW    is one of the largest crane manufacturers in the United States  Founded in 1925  its seen some tough times in its history  It s expected to lose  0 15 this year but rebound to  0 07 a share in 2018 
4     Calumet Specialty Products    NASDAQ CLMT    is a refiner of hydrocarbon products  It took a loss of  3 27 last year  is expected to cut that to just  0 25 this year but 2018 is showing another decline to a loss of  0 95  It hasn t reported yet either  Investors should be checking in on that conference call 
5     Fossil    NASDAQ FOSL    shares are down 57  year to date and now trade under  10 at around  7 80  It made  2 44 in 2016 but is only expected to make  0 68 in 2017  It s still cheap  even though estimates are getting cut  It trades with a forward P E of 12 4  Are watches really dead 
As always  investors should do their homework on any company they are buying  but especially on stocks under  10 
Some tips 
1      Is the company making money or does it have a plan to make money in the near future 
2     Are insiders buying now that the shares have plunged down 
3     Are there rumors of bankruptcy 
Listen in conference calls  Don t just read the transcripts  A lot can be learned by the tone of voice 
What else should investors know about buying value stocks under  10

3025,224540,CLFD,5 Affordable Breakout Stocks For Superlative Returns ,opinion,Seeking out breakout stocks is probably one of the most favored techniques among active investors  The logic behind this kind of stock selection is to determine which stocks are trading within a narrow band  These stocks are to be bought as soon as they move above this channel and sold when they fall below  In case a stock moves above this band  it usually gains momentum At the same time  market watchers warn against incorrectly timing such a move  This is because there is a significant risk of identifying stock movements as breakouts even when this is not the case  However  when utilized judiciously  this strategy yields formidable gains  which is the reason why it remains popular Spotting Prospective CandidatesIn order to identify breakout stocks  you must first determine their resistance and support levels  A resistance level is the barrier which must be broken so as to be identified as a breakout stock  Meanwhile  a support level is the floor for the stock s movement At the breakout level  demand for the stock has peaked  making it a natural choice for traders  On the other hand  when a stock hits the support floor  traders are eager to offload it  In order to spot breakout stocks  you would have to see which of these are on the brink of breaking the resistance barrier or those which have just breached this level Checking Whether It s for RealStocks that have breached their resistance levels should ideally be in high demand among traders  But the test of whether this is a genuine breakout is when they go on to attain higher prices and the old barrier becomes a new support  This is why it is important to determine whether a long term price trend is about to emerge Only a study of long term trends can determine whether the existing trading channel has been breached effectively  This indicates the strength of the support or resistance levels  If you can identify the effective channel for a stock  picking it even at a not so reasonable price would give you significant returns Screening Parameters  Percentage price change over four weeks between 10  and 20   Stocks which are showing considerable price increases  but whose gains are not excessive    Current Price  52 Week High greater than or equal to 0 9  Stocks which are trading 90  close to their 52 week highs

top five stocks that meet these criteria First BanCorp    NYSE FBP   is a bank holding company for FirstBank Puerto Rico which offers a range of financial products and services  First BanCorp has a

3039,224554,CLMT,How To Trade The Oil Rally With ETFs   Stocks,opinion,After being hurt by Hurricane Harvey  positive sentiments have started building up in the oil space with a wave of positive news  Notably  U S  crude is trading below  50 00 per barrel while Brent oil is hovering around  55 00 per barrel  read    Improving TrendsThe historic output cut deal wherein OPEC  which accounts for one third of the global output  Russia and other producers agreed to curb production by 1 8 million barrels per day until next March  is now paying off  This is especially true as OPEC oil output declined in August for the first time since March  The 14 member cartel pumped in 32 76 million barrels per day last month  representing a 79 100 barrel per day drop from July  Hopes of further extension to the pact by at least three months are adding to the optimism in the oil market As the deal aims to check the oil supply glut that has weighed on crude prices for more than three years  OPEC sees signs of a tighter global market and thus raised its global demand outlook for next year  The cartel expects global consumption to rise by 1 42 million barrels per day this year and 1 35 million barrels per day next year  up 50 000 barrels per day and 70 000 barrels per day  respectively  from the previous projection  On the other hand  supply from non OPEC countries would remain unchanged at 780 000 barrels per day for this year but would decline by 100 000 barrel per day from the previous forecast to 1 million barrels per day for next year The International Energy Agency  IEA  projects global demand this year to climb the most in two years as global glut has started to shrink due to stronger than expected consumption in Europe and the United States as well as production declines in OPEC and non OPEC countries It raised global oil demand outlook by 1 7  to 1 6 million barrels per day for this year and by 1 4  to 1 4 million barrels per day for the next  read    Though inventories in developed economies are still 195 million barrels above the five year average  it declined by 18 7 million barrels per day in July and will soon fall to this level given robust demand outlook and falling supplies  Unrest in Iraq and Venezuela will also keep output at check If these weren t enough  the U S  Energy Information Administration lowered its oil production forecast for this year and the next by 1  and 0 7   respectively  The agency expects crude production at an average 9 25 million barrels per day for this year and 9 84 million barrels a day for the next  State of Backwardation  A Big Bull for OilFurther  the oil market has entered into a state of backwardation  where later dated contracts are cheaper than near term contracts  after three long years when oil price was above

3043,224558,CLMT,Dividend Roulette With Refinery MLPs,opinion,"Upstream master limited partnerships  MLPs  have been generally devastated by the decline in oil and gas prices that began in the third quarter of 2014 
Some bankruptcies have occurred  and distributions   the MLP equivalent to corporate dividends and the reason most investors bought these companies   have been slashed 
However  one segment of the energy MLP universe has gone from strength to strength  companies whose principal assets are  
These downstream MLPs offer yields well into the double digits  plus all the excitement of a quarterly earnings roller coaster 
While oil prices remain low  they re an excellent investment   provided you don t need to sleep at night 
A Refined Opportunity
According to the U S  Energy Information Administration  U S  oil refinery capacity has increased 14 8  since 1985  less than half of the 35  population increase during that period 
Although refiners have added capacity and several small refineries have been built recently  the last major U S  refinery to come on stream was completed in 1977 
Additionally  environmental and legal harassments make it unlikely that refiners will add significant capacity in the near future 
Meanwhile  oil prices are down 50  in the last year  and demand for crude oil and refined products has risen by around 5   with a further upward trend likely as consumers drive more and also shift to more gas guzzling vehicles 
On top of all that  three more factors   the United States  increasing self sufficiency in crude oil  the lack of refined products available for import  and increasing overseas demand for products refined in the United States and Canada   have all put further pressure on U S  refineries 
In total  these factors have produced a tightness in U S  refinery utilization that s not likely to diminish until or unless oil prices return to  100 per barrel levels 
Accordingly  margins in the refining business are likely to remain elevated  and capacity utilization is likely to remain close to 100  
That means refinery MLPs should earn good returns  which they ll be forced to distribute 
Best of all  the market hasn t fully adjusted to this new reality  which makes the yields available on refinery MLP stocks truly juicy 
High Risk  High Reward
There are four refinery MLPs  three of which appear attractive for investors 

Northern Tier Energy LP  N NTI  gives you a truly spectacular current yield of 17 7   based on the last four quarters of distributions   though that s not quite covered by earnings over that same period 

However  in the third quarter  Northern Tier earned  1 11 and will go ex distribution on November 12 on a  1 04 distribution  to be paid on November 25  That s very satisfactory indeed 
Northern Tier went public only in 2012  and quarterly distributions since then have fluctuated from  0 31 to  1 48   the classic profile of a refinery MLP  Right now  Northern Tier is selling at 5 1 times book value  with negative tangible net worth  and in the past year its stock price has increased by 5   adding just a bit extra to that incredible yield 

CVR Refining LP  N CVRR  is a large refiner in Coffeyville  Kansas  whose shares currently yield 17 8   based on the last four quarters of distributions  Earnings didn t quite cover the distribution over that period  though the company did cover in the second quarter 

In the third quarter of 2015  CVR Refining earned  0 94 per share compared with a  1 01 distribution  which has just gone ex distribution and will be paid on November 16 
Unlike Northern Tier  CVR Refining s stock price has declined 6  in the past year  though even net of that decline its return is attractive  It also has the additional advantage of a positive net worth  and it trades at 2 1 times book value 

Alon USA Partners LP  N ALDW   which owns a 73 000 barrel per day refinery in Big Spring  Texas  currently yields 16 9   though its distribution isn t quite covered by earnings 

Most recently  it announced third quarter earnings of  0 86 per unit  and it will distribute  0 98 per unit  which goes ex distribution on November 16 and pays on November 25 
Alon has a positive tangible net worth  barely   sells at an eye watering 8 3 times book value  and its share price has risen 36  in the last 12 months  nice indeed but suggesting it may drop back a bit 

Finally  Calumet Specialty Products Partners  O CLMT  is the least attractive of the four  Although it has the broadest base of refined petroleum products  this doesn t seem to lead to much profitability  even when oil prices are weak  as at present 

Indeed  it managed to report a loss in the third quarter  a period when oil prices had sunk to new lows  Its quarterly distribution is  0 685  giving it a yield of 10 3  at current prices  However  that s not much good to us in the long run  since the company made a loss over the last four quarters 
What s more  the stock price is down 6  in the last 12 months  negating much of the benefit of the distribution  and it sells at 2 4 times book value  with a negative tangible net worth  I frankly don t understand why Calumet Specialty s broader range of products prevents it from being as profitable as its peers  so I d suggest avoiding it for now 
At the end of the day  these are risky stocks  but I can t see why the environment shouldn t continue to favor them for some time 
Plus  the 16  to 18  yields on the first three are not to be missed  They re like finding  100 bills in the street 
But go small  however tempting they may be

3046,224561,CLMT,CLMT  Great Long Term Set Up With A Great Short Term Launch,opinion,"Neely s B Failure Flat Set Up

A Crash Followed by a Partial Retrace Followed by a Return to the Crash Low is a Set Up for a Return to the All Time High
Glenn Neely s book    provides a useful collection of trading set ups and data  One particular set up in Neely s book that has paid off time and again in recent years is a formation he calls a B Failure Flat 
You tend to see these formations after crash waves like PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  s crash out of the dot com bubble and the big 2008 plunge in oil  If the crash wave takes a particular form  the reaction wave  or  B wave   that follows tends to retrace roughly 60  of the crash  It doesn t have to be 60   It just has to be a significant retrace that doesn t make it back to the high 
The B wave reaction tops with range trading  typically forming a head and shoulders or megaphone top or an extended triangle  then the price collapses  in a  C wave   back to the crash wave low 
Calumet Specialty Products Partners  NASDAQ CLMT  is about to complete this pattern  After it completes a bottom  its next target is the all time high 
Here s the set up on QQQ 


Neely B Failure Flat Set Up on QQQ
Here s the set up on oil 


Same Set Up on Oil
It s a set up about a price that is taking huge swings around a correct price roughly in the middle 
A Great Short Term Entry is Setting Up for CLMT s Big Move Up


CLMT Opted to Start a Bottoming Pattern in the Critical Decision Wave of its Navy Price Channel
CLMT appears to be putting in an island bottom with a neckline at roughly 6  see top chart   Obviously a gap up from an island bottom would be a great set up to get long 
But for more nimble traders  a beautiful price channel bottoming set up can get you in closer to the bottom 
Specifically  on the move down out of the early 2017 high  CLMT confirmed a price channel  navy blue in chart above   And in the channel s critical decision wave  meaning the new channel low after two alternating touches on both the top and bottom   CLMT took a swing back up to the channel top rather than breaking out the bottom 
That channel provided a beautiful melt down set up to zero if CLMT was heading into bankruptcy  Instead CLMT started a megaphone bottom  pink in chart   A breakout now through the channel top would target roughly the pink megaphone top at the 200 dma  A final retest of the 40 dma would be the retrace to the pink megaphone VWAP that would set up a breakout up to the island bottom neckline at 6 
Typically there would be a bit of a consolidation there before the gap up into the big move up 
CLMT would typically bog down at roughly the 30 level on its big move up usually to attempt a topping pattern like a head and shoulders at the red megaphone VWAP  The topping pattern would usually end up breaking out upwards to set up a big rising megaphone melt up back to the all time high 
We could also see a big Sornette melt up set up across 30 before blast off 
Hat tip to  jasteindorf1 for the stock  He has personal expertise in this company and product  The view of the stock provided  however  is strictly based on chart trading set ups  not fundamentals  Do your own due diligence 
You could long on the price channel breakout and set your stop a little below the pink megaphone VWAP or 40 dma after breaking through ",2017-04-24,Trader Moe,https://www.investing.com/analysis/clmt-–-great-long-term-set-up-with-a-great-short-term-launch-200184524,200184524

NASDAQ   NASDAQ IMMU      and Hudbay Minerals  NYSE   TO HBM      By Kevin MatrasExplosive Stocks Under  10This screen is a bit of a departure from my normal stock screens Usually I require my screens to have a minimum price of  10 per share But I do at times scan for stocks under  10  And that s one of the screens I m running for myself right now Penny StocksOne dollar is a common threshold when screening for stocks  A lot of investors actively avoid penny stocks due to the speculative nature  the often wide bid ask spreads  and the excessive volatility that is all too common in stocks under  1 00 But some  of course  work out spectacularly well  And that s probably what keeps people interested in them Seeing a stock make a 100  return or 200  return or more from a base of 50 cents  for example  seems easier than investing in a  50 stock or  100 stock and seeing that double or triple  5 StocksFive dollars is another common minimum when screening for stocks since many institutional investors won t even consider a stock if it s trading under  5  And since institutional investors are usually the ones that can move a stock  having stocks that are open to them is usually a bonus And quite frankly  lots of cheap stocks are cheap for a reason  i e   that s all they re worth But being over  5 does put them into a different category of consideration  Maybe not the best category  but a step up from stocks less than a dollar Stocks Under  10My minimum has typically been  10  With over 10 000 stocks out there  this minimum quickly lets me cull down several thousand stocks with a click of a button That doesn t mean there aren t any good stocks below that price point  because there are And I can recall several sub  10 stocks in the past that worked out exceptionally well  Maybe it s because I use them sparingly  Or maybe it s because I m ultra picky in selecting them Either way  there can be a place for cheaper stocks in your portfolio sometimes And that s what we re looking at today Screen Parameters  Price less than or equal to  10  Average Dollar Volume greater than or equal to  1 000 000 Price x volume shows you how much money is trading in and out of the stock on a daily basis    Weekly Volume greater than Previous Week s Volume  any two out of three weeks  Want to see increasing volume to show greater investor interest and demand    Zacks Rank less than or

3054,224569,CLFD,ViaSat  VSAT  Earnings And Revenues Miss Estimates In Q1,opinion,ViaSat Inc    NASDAQ VSAT   posted yet another earnings miss in the first quarter of fiscal of 2017  The company posted adjusted earnings  including stock based compensation adjustments  of 6 cents per share in first quarter fiscal 2017 which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents by 60  GAAP earnings came in at 4 cents  down 20  from 5 cents in the year ago quarter The bottom line deterioration is largely attributable to a rise in cost of service revenues and selling  general   administrative expenses Inside the HeadlinesThe company posted revenues of  363 1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017  led by robust growth in Satellite Services  Though revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  366 million  it was up 5 4  year over year Segment wise  Satellite Services revenues achieved a record high for the fourth consecutive quarter  up 15 1  year over year to  152 4 million  The impressive figures were driven by continued strength in residential broadband offerings and a thriving in flight connectivity business However  Commercial Networks revenues continued to show weakness  edging down 1 8  on a year over year basis to  65 6 million  This was largely a result of lack of activities due to the completion of certain antenna systems and mobile broadband satellite communications systems programs  However  these declines were somewhat offset by a higher number of broadband terminal orders received under the NBN project On the other hand  Government Systems reported record revenues of  145 2 million  flat on a year over year basis  This was primarily fuelled by strong performance in government satellite communications systems products  offset by softness in the information assurance product line During the quarter  sales backlog increased 4 6  year over year to  912 9 million  Adjusted EBIDTA rose 3 5  from the comparable quarter last year to  80 2 million Quarterly HighlightsViaSat s Satellite Services average revenue per user  ARPU  in the residential internet business grew 8   primarily fuelled by higher bandwidth  increased value plans and growth in value added services  Also  the company s high speed in flight Internet service was selected by American Airlines for its new Boeing  NYSE BA  737 MAX fleet  Moreover  in partnership with Eutelsat  ViaSat launched in flight Internet service in Europe in collaboration with EL AL Israel Airlines Moreover  the company s Commercial Networks business  ViaSat 2 satellite communications platform passed critical program milestones  including completion of assembly  functional performance and first phase of environmental testing in preparation for a launch window  Also  the collaboration between ViaSat and Boeing Satellite Systems International  BSSI  on the ViaSat 3 program is progressing well as the two organizations continue to integrate ViaSat s communications payload with Boeing s upgraded platform Finally  the company s Government Systems business is progressing well as ViaSat was awarded a sole source contract to provide global in flight connectivity service to Air Force One and other prestigious U S  government senior leader aircraft  Also  the company continued to execute on its contract with NEXCOM  Navy Exchange Service Command   which proved conducive to Managed Wi Fi revenues In addition  Royal Canadian Air Force selected ViaSat s KOR 24A STT technology for its CP 140 Aurora aircraft and the company also managed to secure NSA certification for two of its information assurance encryption devices LiquidityViaSat exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  47 2 million  compared with  42 5 million as of Jun 30  2015 VIASAT INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   To ConcludeViaSat s first quarter fiscal 2017 results can be best described as mixed with the bottom line performance lagging expectations but revenue growth continuing  The company s ViaSat 1 satellite remains a star performer even after five years of launch  delivering record earnings and margins  Going forward  the company aspires to deliver more bandwidth efficient satellites and improve its stronghold in regional and global markets by leveraging on its state of the art technology  ViaSat exhibits a bullish sentiment regarding the launch of ViaSat 2 class satellites as it compounds the company s ability to expand its foothold in residential broadband  mobile WiFi  aeronautical and maritime applications in both thriving commercial and

3063,224578,CLMT,3 High Yield Stocks with Great Growth Prospects,opinion,"Markets suffered heavy losses on Friday following heightened international concerns  The S P 500 and the Dow both registered their worst one day percentage declines in more than three weeks  More significantly  all benchmarks closed in the red for the week after two successive weekly gains  Following losses for the month of March  these losses once again raise questions about the kind of volatility stocks may have to face in the days ahead 
More Volatility Ahead 
The first holiday shortened week of April saw two benchmarks registering weekly gains even as the NASDAQ declined  Despite last week s losses  all benchmarks have gained over the month till date  Additionally  the CBOE Volatility Index  VIX   also known as the fear gauge of the markets  had moved lower recently  Such a movement signals a reduction in market volatility and consequently an increase in investor confidence 
But on Friday  the market s fear gauge increased 10 2  to settle at 13 89  The VIX had gained in excess of 11  in early trading  This is a clear indication that volatility has returned to plague investors  Also  most of the data released last week was dismal in nature  Reports on housing  jobless claims  retail sales and CPI were uniformly disappointing 
Long Term Fundamentals Strong
However  long term fundamentals of the U S  economy and equity markets remain firmly in place  The job situation continues to improve and the Fed is set to raise rates later this year  The economies of Europe  China and Japan continue to display weakness  It is widely expected that the U S  will power the world s growth story this year 
Most market watchers believe that markets will stabilize by end 2015  However  they also expect volatility to continue on a day to day basis  In this environment  stocks offering high yields make for good choices  These stocks offer higher income in the current low rate environment and also offer a cushion against equity market risks 
Moreover  dividend stocks are historically less volatile than non dividend stocks and are proven outperformers over the long term  These stocks are a safe bet to create wealth  as the dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty 
These stocks provide downside protection by offering sizable yields on a regular basis  At the same time  all benchmarks have gained over the year to date  This is why it is crucial to pick stocks that offer high yields but also offer the promise of growth when the markets eventually pick up steam 
Our Choices
To identity stocks that are offering high yields along with good growth prospects  we have relied on our new  
Our Growth Style Score condenses all the essential metrics from the company s financial statements to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of its growth  Our research shows that stocks with Growth Style Scores of  A  or  B  when combined Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or Zacks Rank  2  Buy  offer the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space 
Based upon the above criteria  we have selected three stocks that could be promising picks  Not only do these stocks have a favorable Zacks Rank and offer high yield  they also a Growth Style Score of  A  or  B  
Sprague Resources LP operates as a supplier of energy and materials handling services  The company stores  distributes  and sells refined petroleum products and natural gas  Its products include home heating oil  diesel fuels  residual fuels  gasoline and natural gas 
Sprague Resources holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has a Growth Style Score of  B   The company has dividend yield of 7  
Atlas Resource Partners LP  NYSE ARP  develops and produces crude oil  natural gas and related liquids  Atlas Resource Partners operates in basins located across the U S   including Colorado  Tennessee and Indiana 
Atlas Resource Partners holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and has a Growth Style Score of  A   The company has dividend yield of 14 9  
Calumet Specialty Products Partners  NASDAQ CLMT  produces specialty hydrocarbon products in North America  Calumet focusses on processing crude oil into customized lubricating oils  solvents  and waxes used in consumer  industrial  and automotive products 
Apart from a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Calumet Specialty Products has a Growth Style Score of  A   The company has dividend yield of 10 4  
Dealing with volatility is something investors may have to get used to in 2015  At the same the time  growth prospects cannot be ignored in an effort to hedge risk  This is why these stocks would make for good additions to your portfolio ",2015-04-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-high-yield-stocks-with-great-growth-prospects-249065,249065
3064,224579,CLFD,Buy 4 Wireless Equipment Manufacturers On Strong Demand,opinion,The global telecommunications industry is witnessing rapid technological improvement   A growing global economy speeds up the demand for real time voice  data  and video manifold  The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans  This in turn has stimulated the requirement for telecom infrastructure developers  particularly wireless equipment manufacturers Massive government spending like U S  broadband infrastructure development program and similar structural subsidies in China and India  have been a boon to telecom service providers and equipment manufacturers   At this stage  investment in wireless equipment stocks with favorable Zacks Rank will be lucrative Strong Wireless Infrastructure MarketFifth generation  5G  superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry  In September 2017  Moody s Investors Service stated in a report that the evolution towards 5G wireless networks will result in higher capital spending for the U S  wireless carriers In this regard  Internet of Things  IoT  has the potential to emerge the numero uno factor for future growth in the space  Statista s 2018 report estimates that global telecom services revenues will reach around  1 5 trillion in 2019 4G LTE ThrivingThe LTE network has the highest penetration rate of 90 5  in the North American region  Both Western Europe region   Oceania and Eastern   South eastern Asia region have a LTE penetration rate of 54   In the Latin American and Caribbean region  LTE market share has more than doubled year over year to 23  in 2017 This figure is projected to grow 28  by the end of this year and further to 59  in 2021  By the end of 2020  C RAN  small cells  DAS and carrier Wi Fi  together with their fronthaul and backhaul segments  will account for more than 45  of total wireless infrastructure spending Growing Demand for Fiber Optic NetworkFiber optic cable is a vital infrastructure in order to meet the growing need for cloud based business data  along with more video streaming services by individuals  Moreover  fiber optic cable network is vital for backhaul and last mile local loop  which are required by wireless service providers for their upcoming 5G network Dark fiber provides abundant bandwidth which is of utmost necessity for the smooth functioning of high speed wireless networks such as 4G and 5G  Fiber networks are essential for the growing deployment of small cells  The increase in adoption of small cells can be attributed to the inconvenience in installing large towers in inaccessible areas Pro Growth MeasuresThe two pro growth agendas of President Trump  namely  significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the Telecom industry  The corporate tax rate was recently lowered from 35  to 21    marking the rate s lowest in 78 years  Trump s tax proposal will result in a huge windfall for telecom operators  The carriers can utilize this money for 5G network R D and its deployment  This will naturally bolster demand for wireless equipment The telecom regulatory body  Federal Communications Commission  FCC   which was revamped by Trump  repealed the Net Neutrality laws in December 2017  Telecom industry will immensely benefit from this decision and will ramp up their project investment  Higher telecom expenditure will eventually benefit wireless equipment manufacturers Our PicksThe U S  wireless equipment industry has lately emerged as an intensely contested space where success thrives largely on technical superiority  quality of services and scalability  In order to stay abreast of competition  existing players need to be constantly on their toes  introducing innovative products to gain from the industry s growing momentum Taking into account these factors  we narrowed down our search to four stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank and a strong growth potential The chart below depicts price performance of our four picks in last three months Comtech Telecommunications Corp    NASDAQ CMTL   designs  develops

3065,224580,CLMT,Trade War Worsens And Everyone Is Weighing In,opinion,"The Trump Navarro trade war rhetoric ratchets higher  And jawboning the Fed is now added to the turmoil  our colleague Bob Eisenbeis has recently reflected on that one here  Meanwhile  most of the world is now labeled a currency manipulator by POTUS in his latest salvo 
For those who missed the discussion I had on Bloomberg Radio with Bryan Curtis and Rishaad Salamat about trade and the secondary impacts of the trade war here  The clip is seven minutes 
The stock market remains somewhat immune to the Twitter storms  The US Treasury yield curve remains in flat to flattening mode  And the earnings from the second quarter reports mostly exceed expectations 
We enter August and the summer hurricane season with a blizzard of bizarre policy lurches originating in Washington  Meanwhile the evidence of damage from the trade war grows daily  Markets may want to ignore these anecdotes  We think they deserve more respect 
Bullets 
For those who missed it  here is the Trump threat of the  505 billion tariff war escalation   Trump says he s  ready  to put tariffs on all  505 billion of Chinese goods imported to the US  President Donald Trump has indicated that he is willing to slap tariffs on every Chinese good imported to the US should the need arise  
 Steel prices have gone up after the trade war broke out   says Torsten Slok  Deutsche Bank Securities  Torsten notes a 40  rise in the futures prices of Midwest Domestic Hot Rolled Coil Index futures 
 The Trump administration announced last Tuesday that it is prepared to impose 10  tariffs on  200 billion of Chinese made products  ranging from clothing to television parts to refrigerators  Together with other tariffs already in the works  the latest move threatens to raise import prices on almost half of everything the US buys from China  which means that Inflation could be one of the biggest disruptions to US equity and bond markets from the escalating trade war     Joe McAlinden  former CIO and Chief Global Strategist at Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  Investment Management  where he oversaw more than  400 billion dollars in assets 
Here is Steve Roach s warning about Trump trade war tactics   Trump trade tactics sabotaging the economy and markets  Stephen Roach warns  Yale senior fellow Stephen Roach says the markets are too complacent when it comes to trade war risks   Read more 
Here is Danielle DiMartino Booth  focused on clues that we may discern about trade war damage   Unlike some states with waning manufacturing sectors dominated by a handful of factories that have lingered  US Steel is but one of many manufacturers populating the state of Indiana     Some of the biggies include pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY   engine builder Cummins  NYSE CMI   Calumet Specialty Products Partners  NASDAQ CLMT   a refiner  plastics manufacturer Berry Global  NYSE BERY   and medical device maker Zimmer Biomet  NYSE ZBH    Add up all the manufacturers  big and small  from Lake Michigan to the Ohio River  and you re talking about a powerhouse state  At 28 6  of its gross state product  Indiana relies more than any other state on its manufacturing sector  According to the Indiana Manufacturing Association  the Hoosier State s manufacturing output passed the  100 billion for the first time last year  Only California  Illinois  North Carolina  Ohio  and Texas have larger sectors   In the event you don t know where this is headed  the Hoosier State is also the 11th largest exporting state  Its economy relies more on its factory sector than any other  and it is thus the primary state to monitor for damage emanating from the trade war   Combine the trade war headwinds  Indiana s strengths cum weaknesses of manufacturing and export industries and the state s richly valued jobless claims  and you have a recipe for a correction on your hands   Applying the same three gauges   manufacturing as a share of the state s economy  exports  and jobless claims trends   to the rest of the country  we can identify the other nine most exposed states to round out our Top Ten list  They are  listed in descending order of exposure  North Carolina  Oregon  Wisconsin  Washington  Ohio  Michigan  South Carolina  Alabama  and Georgia  These are the states where the good economic deeds accomplished can perversely come back to haunt them  
Politico on July 19  Morning Money  reported that  The Commerce Department is holding a day long hearing on Thursday to hear from 45 witnesses in their investigation into whether imported automobiles and parts present a national security threat and should be subject to tariffs of up to 25 percent  It is not likely to go well for proponents of such tariffs  Per POLITICO trade ace Doug Palmer  all but one of the scheduled witnesses will testify AGAINST the tariffs  The U S  automotive industry almost uniformly opposes the tariffs   Note this item revealed by Senator Doug Jones   Just one of out 45 witnesses today is expected to testify in favor of imposing tariffs on autos and auto     The lone exception is Jennifer Kelly  research director of the United Automobile Workers  which revealed its support in public comments filed last month with the department  
More on autos from Politico   Nearly all of the 44 other witnesses filed comments expressing opposition to President Donald Trump s threat to impose a 20 or 25 percent duty on foreign made autos and parts  Those include the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers  which represents Ford  GM  Fiat Chrysler  as well as foreign brands such as Mercedes Benz  Honda  Toyota  Hyundai  Volkswagen  Nissan and Subaru  Auto dealers and parts manufacturers also will testify in opposition to the tariffs  which a forthcoming paper by the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates would raise car prices by  1 408 to  2 057 for a  17 000 vehicle   2 093 to  3 066 for a  22 500 vehicle  and  4 708 to  6 972 for a  35 000 vehicle  
Dear readers  we will stop here  We have already mentioned in previous writings the trade war impacts unfolding in the agriculture sector  from soybeans to lobsters  Now this round is about the manufacturing sector 
The lessons of history are clear and have no exceptions  Everyone loses in a trade war  The Trump Navarro policy is hurtling toward a disaster if history is any guide  Many believe that the present policy direction will undo all the benefits of the tax cuts  repatriations  and fiscal stimulus  We are among those who are seriously worried about these outcomes 
We expect upward inflation price pressures  slowing of growth rates  and lurching gyrations in the foreign currency exchange markets  We don t know where this ends  We are applying caution in all portfolios

3070,224585,CLMT,Stocks Recoup Monday s Losses  Dow Adds 112,opinion,Investors pushed the major averages higher on Tuesday a day after the market fell in the wake of a bailout for Cyprus  Sentiment was boosted by a series of economic reports in the United States that showed the housing market is on the mend and the economy remains stable  Consumer confidence data  however  was a surprise disappointment  Nevertheless  investors were looking to take risk as the markets may be prepared to move beyond the situation in Cyprus next week  Major Averages The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 112 points  or 0 77 percent  to 14 560  The S P 500 rose better than 12 points  or 0 78 percent  to 1 564  The Nasdaq added 17 points  or 0 53 percent  to 3 252  Durable Goods Orders Durable goods orders surged 5 7 percent in February after declining 3 8 percent in January  This compared to consensus expectations of a rise of 3 8 percent for the month  The strength in the report was largely due to transportation with transportation equipment orders jumping 21 7 percent  Not including transportation  durable goods orders declined 0 5 percent  Consumer Confidence Consumer confidence data released on Tuesday was a cause for concern  The Conference Board s Consumer Confidence report for March showed a steep decline to 59 7 from 68 0 in the prior month  This was way below economists  consensus estimates of a decline to 65 0  The Expectations Index also fell from 72 4 down to 60 9  Although confidence is important to economic activity  the primary driver is income growth  The steep decline  however  suggests that the consumer outlook is not as rosy as had been hoped  New Home Sales New home sales fell 4 6 percent on a month over month basis in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 411 000  This missed consensus estimates of 426 000  but was a significant 12 3 percent increase over last year  On a regional basis  sales fell 13 3 percent in the Northeast  rose 13 7 percent in the Midwest  fell 9 7 percent in the South and declined 2 1 percent in the West  Nevertheless  the data was strong on a year over year basis and the housing market remains on an upward trajectory  Commodities Late in Tuesday s trading session  the entire energy complex was moving higher  At last check  NYMEX crude futures had risen 1 57 percent to  96 30 while Brent contracts were up 1 08 percent to  109 34  Natural gas had added almost 3 percent to  3 98 near the close of equities  Precious metals were trading moderately lower towards the end of the equity session  COMEX gold futures had lost 0 39 percent to  1 600 40 while silver was off by 0 43 percent to  28 70  Copper futures were last up 0 28 percent  In the grains complex  corn and wheat were

was down better than one percent  Bonds Heading into the closing bell  the iShares Barclays 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  NYSE     was up 0 11 percent to  117 35  The small gain for bonds pushed yields lower  The 2 Year Note yield was unchanged at 0 25 percent  but the 5 Year Note yield fell by one basis point to 0 77 percent  The yield on the 10 Year Note and 30 Year Bond fell two and one basis point to 1 90 percent and 3 14 percent  respectively  Currencies The U S  dollar was unchanged on Tuesday  with the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish ETF  NYSE     which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of foreign currencies  trading around the flat line late in the day  The closely watched EUR USD pair was also unchanged on the session at  1 2857  The USD JPY rose 0 34 percent on Tuesday while the USD CAD fell 0 51 percent  Volatility and Volume The VIX fell sharply on Tuesday as the Dow climbed better than triple digits  The widely watched fear guage lost almost 8 percent to 12 70  Volume was noticeably light on the day  with less than 75 million SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE    shares trading hands compared to a 3 month daily average of 129 million  Stock Movers

3073,224588,CLMT,Pick Your Energy MLPs Carefully,opinion,"Crude Oil prices appear to have settled around  50  half the level of last summer 
For income investors  that has played merry hell with the economics of energy master limited partnerships  previously considered one of the most attractive sources of high  stable dividends 
A number of energy MLPs have slashed their dividends  and even appear likely to operate at a loss going forward  However  there are still substantial parts of the sector where dividends appear more reliable  and income investors should seek out these lucrative opportunities 
The biggest problems have arisen in energy MLPs that own reserves and produce oil from them  which isn t surprising  After all  if the price of your product halves  you re bound to struggle  But it also reflects a deeper reality  Many MLPs represent pools of assets spun off in recent years with relatively high cost bases 
Now  a Saudi Arabian MLP would still be profitable  because Saudi Arabia s production costs are a fraction of the current oil prices  However  marginal producers in high cost sectors  especially those using expensive  fracking  techniques  are much harder to manage 
That s why companies such as Linn Energy LLC  NASDAQ LINE  and BreitBurn Energy Partners LP  NASDAQ BBEP  recently  and are struggling to remain profitable 
Mining the Midstream
In the middle are  that make their money from transporting and storing energy  Lower energy prices are generally beneficial for these MLPs  as lower prices increase demand  consumption  and throughput  On the other hand  if they own oil or receive revenue on a percentage royalty basis  they may be exposed to price declines 
Recently  their earnings have been relatively strong  but the largest and most stable of these companies tend to have high price tags  Enbridge Energy Partners LP  NYSE EEP   for example  has a forward P E multiple of 27x  and a trailing P E of infinity   although its 5 9  dividend yield is attractive 
Plains All American Pipeline LP  NYSE PAA   a  19 billion MLP  has a yield of 5 2  and a forward P E multiple of a somewhat more reasonable 19 8x  Both of these companies earn less than the dividends they pay  because pipelines can be depreciated  causing non cash operating costs  Conversely  they have a finite life  so their earnings may be a truer guide to their value than the dividends 
Finally  World Point Terminals  which stores refined and crude oil products  has a dividend yield of 6  and a forward P E multiple of a slightly more reasonable 17 2x  All three of these companies are attractive income investments in today s low interest rate world  because their profits are more or less independent of oil prices 
A Few Refined Opportunities
Finally  there s one group of income oriented companies that benefits from oil price declines  MLPs that own  
Oil refineries benefit from falling crude prices in several ways  First  a decline in the price of gasoline and other oil products increases consumption  Motorists drive more and switch to more gas guzzling cars  SUVs  and trucks  while many energy users switch to petroleum products 
Refineries may also benefit from weak crude prices because their output prices can be held  sticky  as their input prices decline 
Of course  refining company earnings fluctuate greatly from quarter to quarter  which normally leads dividends to be highly variable  as well  To get around this problem  some refining companies pay dividends out of capital in periods when earnings are depressed   though  you should worry about the extent to which the investment is self liquidating  You don t want it to leave you with nothing after a relatively short period 
And since refineries themselves have a finite life  require refurbishment  and deliver a fluctuating cash flow  there s a fair amount of risk inherent when investing in them  especially over a very long period  such as retirement 
Still  their yields can be truly attractive in periods of weak oil prices  Thus  I ve identified three refinery assets worth considering in today s environment 
Refinery Asset No  1  Calumet Specialty Products Partners  NASDAQ CLMT   Calumet specializes in the kind of offbeat petroleum related products with sales volume that can increase rapidly when prices fall  Its quarterly dividend was  0 63 in 2008  then fell to  0 45 during the 2009 recession as sales of its varied product line fell  Since then  it has recovered to a current level of  0 685  giving it a yield of 10 8  at current prices  However  third quarter earnings were only  0 08 per share after  0 25 of derivatives losses   nowhere near covering the current dividend  Fourth quarter earnings are due February 27  If they exceed the quarter s dividend  this looks like a good  Buy  
Refinery Asset No  2  Northern Tier Energy LP  NYSE NTI   Northern will give you a truly spectacular current yield of 12 7   based on the last four quarters  dividends  and it appears able to justify that from current operations  However  it went public only in 2012  and quarterly dividends since then have fluctuated from  0 31 to  1 48   the classic profile of a refinery MLP  NTI made  1 04 per unit in the third quarter and distributed  1  but its fourth quarter dividend  to be paid February 27  was a somewhat disappointing  0 49  Still  that yield is very attractive  and unlike CLMT  NTI doesn t seem to pay out more than it earns 
Refinery Asset No  3  CVR Refining  CVRR   CVR Refining is a large refiner in Coffeyville  Kansas  with shares currently yielding 10 7   based on the last four quarters  dividends  But the latest dividend  with an ex dividend date of February 26  was only  0 37   and fourth quarter earnings showed a loss of  112 million because of a FIFO accounting loss of  154 6 million  a one off caused by the fall in oil prices   For the year as a whole  CVRR made  2 43 per share and paid dividends of  2 16

3091,224606,CLMT,Exclusive  Chevron  Exxon seek  small refinery  waivers from U S  biofuels law,news,"By Jarrett Renshaw and Chris Prentice NEW YORK  Reuters    Global energy giants  Chevron  Corp and  Exxon Mobil  have asked U S  regulators for exemptions to the nation s biofuels policy that have historically been reserved for small companies in financial distress  according to sources familiar with the matter  The requests will add fuel to a raging dispute between Big Oil and Big Corn over how the Trump administration should manage the U S  Renewable Fuel Standard   a 2005 law that requires oil refiners to mix biofuels such as corn based ethanol into the nation s fuel supply  or buy government awarded credits from other energy firms who do the blending  The U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  has already issued an unusually high 25 hardship waivers to small refineries in recent months  according to an agency source  driving blending credit prices down and helping the oil industry reduce compliance costs  But the agency won t name the firms receiving the exemptions  citing a concern over disclosing private company information  Both Chevron  N CVX  and Exxon  N XOM   among the world s most profitable energy companies  have asked EPA for waivers for their smallest facilities   Chevron s 54 500 barrel per day refinery in Utah and the Exxon s 60 000 bpd refinery in Montana  two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity   The exemptions would free the plants from their obligation to hand in blending credits earned or purchased for 2017  which came due this year  the sources said  The disclosure of the Chevron and Exxon applications  which have not been previously reported  follow a Reuters report this month that the EPA has exempted three of ten refineries owned by Andeavor  N ANDV   one of the biggest U S  refining companies   The waivers could save Andeavor  50 million or more in regulatory costs for the company s 2016 obligations under the biofuels law  Husky Energy   a Canadian oil giant backed by a Hong Kong billionaire   will also be seeking an exemption  this one covering the 2018 requirements for its small Superior  Wisconsin plant  spokesman Mel Duval told Reuters  disclosing the waiver for the first time  Duval said Husky inherited a 2017 exemption when it bought the 50 000 bpd Superior refinery from  Calumet Specialty  Products Partners  O CLMT  for  435 million in November  The waivers are intended for facilities producing less than 75 000 barrels per day  bpd  that can also prove compliance with the policy would cause them  disproportionate economic hardship   A spokesman for Chevron  Braden Reddall  declined to confirm or deny the application  but said waivers provide an edge   Several competitors have reportedly received exemptions from the RFS   he said in a written statement to Reuters   If true  any refinery which has not been exempted from the RFS will be at a competitive disadvantage    Exxon spokesman Dan Carter declined to comment  The exceptions and the EPA s refusal to disclose them have infuriated the corn lobby  which argues the waivers hurt farmers by undermining demand for corn and should be used only sparingly for tiny facilities in dire straits   EPA is hiding behind poor excuses about proprietary business information to shield big oil companies from public scrutiny   five Republican senators  including Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst from Iowa  wrote in a joint statement Thursday    This looks like just another backdoor attempt by  EPA  Administrator  Scott  Pruitt to destroy the Renewable Fuel Standard and circumvent congressional intent    Bob Dinneen  head of the Renewable Fuels Association said there is nothing  small  about Exxon and Chevron  both of which rank in the top 20 of the Fortune 100    For these two behemoth oil companies to claim economic hardship is downright offensive and insulting to the hard working farm families and ethanol producers that depend on the RFS   Dinneen said  It s unclear whether the EPA has approved the Exxon or Chevron application  EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman declined to comment on which firms have applied for or received exemptions   She said the agency considers any application to exempt a refinery of less than 75 000 bpd   regardless of the size of the company that owns it   EPA decisions on waivers are based on refinery specific information   she said in an email   We continue to work through petitions received for 2017   Exxon reported net profits of  19 7 billion last year  Chevron reported earning  9 2 billion  Both bill themselves as globally integrated companies  and neither breaks out the financial details for their individual facilities in the public disclosures they are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission   Republican Senator John Barrasso  of Wyoming  home to several small refineries  praised the expansion of the exemption program in a statement on Thursday  He did not address the controversy over the exemptions granted to some of the nation s largest refiners   I applaud Administrator Pruitt and Secretary Perry for recognizing the burdens of this program  They know that we can t allow it to hurt our nation s small refineries   Barrasso said    DEMAND DESTRUCTION  The EPA has historically doled out fewer than ten hardship exemptions per year to U S  refineries  according to a former U S  official who spoke on condition of anonymity  A current EPA official  however  said the number reached 20 for 2016  The EPA has come under pressure for being stingy with the waivers in the past  A successful lawsuit last year by Sinclair Oil Corporation led a federal court to order EPA to expand its definition of  economic hardship    opening the door for more facilities to be eligible  The Trump administration has also signaled a willingness to help refining companies reduce their biofuels compliance costs   which industry players say has encouraged a surge in recent applications  Trump hosted a series of meetings with advocates for the corn and oil industries at the White House since late last year aimed at reforming biofuels regulations in a way that cuts costs for refiners without reducing overall biofuels demand  The effort failed to yield a deal due to protests from corn industry representatives  Obtaining a waiver helps refiners in two ways  they no longer have to earn or purchase blending credits  called RINs  to prove compliance  and they can sell any RINs they have on hand into the open market  That can provide a company with a benefit ranging into the tens of millions of dollars  Other big oil companies including Phillips 66  N PSX  also own refineries small enough to be eligible for a waiver  as does CVR Energy  N CVI  which is owned by billionaire investor and Trump ally Carl Icahn   Officials for those companies did not respond to requests for comment on whether they are seeking exemptions  Icahn s efforts last year to overhaul the biofuels program   while acting as an adviser to Trump on regulatory issues   drew scrutiny from federal investigators after lawmakers said it raised ethical concerns  Biofuels proponents including U S  Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has criticized the use of RFS exemptions as  demand destruction  for corn based ethanol  Ethanol demand has been vital to farmers who are buffeted by low commodities prices and the threat of a global trade war  
The American Petroleum Institute  which represents big oil companies like Exxon and Chevron  has also opposed small refinery exemptions in the past  arguing for a level competitive playing field ",2018-04-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/exclusive-chevron-exxon-seek-small-refinery-waivers-from-us-biofuels-law-1392559,1392559

3099,224614,CLMT,4 Top Ranked Oil Stocks To Buy On OPEC Cuts  Trade Truce ,opinion,On Jul 2  OPEC decided to extend the existing production cuts till March 2020  In doing so  the oil cartel successfully tided over internal differences  agreeing instead to reaffirm measures that supported oil prices in the recent past  Surging U S  shale output and global economic sluggishness have forced the production bloc to renew such measures several times now However  only a lasting U S  China trade deal can provide oil with sufficient upside in the second half of the year  Last week  both sides made major concessions  declaring a truce  Notably  Trump agreed to ease restrictions on Huawei  gladdening investors A near term rate  which looks increasingly likely  would also support higher levels of demand  This is why it still makes sense to bet on select oil stocks at this time OPEC Extends Production ControlsEven though the core group has decided to provide an extension to production controls  the deal still needs approval from non member countries  However  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih said on Jul 2 that he was sure these countries  particularly Russia  would agree to the extension Currently  production controls stand at around 1 2 million barrels per day  A major factor for enforcing such controls has been the jump in U S  oil production  particularly from shale related sources However  al Falih thinks   U S  shale will peak and the decline like every other basin in history  over time  And till then such measures would be  prudent for us that have a lot at stake  as well as for those concerned about the global economy  he feels Trade Truce  Rate Cuts Key to Upside in 2H19Despite the extension of production controls  the future of oil prices will largely be determined by trade relations between the United States and China  According to Energy Aspects  chief oil analyst Amrita Sen  the price outlook will largely be guided by the outcome of the next round of U S  China talks Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday  Sen said that a lot depends on a U S  China trade deal since global demand has declined considerably  But she thinks that there  will be some momentum to solve some of these trade wars   probably alluding to the run up to the U S  presidential elections  Trump would want to do little to roil markets and the economy at this point Another factor potentially creating upside for oil prices for the rest of the year is the increasing likelihood of a near term rate cut  With the Federal Reserve intent on fashioning policy  which would support America s growth momentum  oil market demand could improve in the near future  thinks Sen  Our ChoicesOPEC s decision to extend production controls until early next year will go a long way in supporting oil prices in the near future  Upside potential has also been improved by the rising likelihood of better U S  China trade relations  especially in the run up to U S  presidential elections A near term rate cut by the Federal Reserve would also go a long way in supporting oil market demand  This is why it remains prudent to invest in oil stocks  However  picking winning stocks may be

3100,224615,CLMT,Sunoco  SUN  Hits 52 Week High  What s Behind The Uptrend ,opinion,Sunoco LP s   NYSE SUN   units attained a 52 week high of  32 44 on Jul 5  before eventually closing at  32 40  generating a healthy year to date rate of more than 19   Robust acquisitions  cost cut measures and high yield have been fueling the firm s performance  Notably  the partnership gained around 28 5  over a year against the broader  s decline of 6 2   Let s take a closer look at the factors driving the stock Repositioning of the Business Model Pays Off The strategic shift from partnership operated convenience stores to fuel supply business came to fruition  In January 2018  Sunoco closed the deal to divest most of its convivence stores to 7 Eleven to sharpen focus on the fuel supply business  Offloading bulk of retail assets was a big deal for Sunoco as those properties accounted for more than 33  of the partnership s top line  Nonetheless  the massive transformation worked much in favor of Sunoco as it trimmed the partnership s heavy debt burden and streamlined its portfolio  As part of the deal  Sunoco entered into a 15 year agreement with 7 Eleven to sell 2 2 billion gallons of fuel annually  thereby improving the partnership s financial profile and becoming a pure play for the distribution of gasoline The proceeds from the sale were used to tap opportunistic acquisitions Slew of Buyouts Bode WellSunoco s array of fuel distribution and terminal acquisitions are expected to be highly accretive to distributable cash flows  while realizing substantial cost synergies  The four bolt on purchases made in the course of 2018 should aid the partnership s net income and EBITDA significantly In April 2018  Sunoco had acquired the wholesale fuel distribution business from Superior Plus Corporation  The business distributes roughly 200 million gallons of fuel every year  To bolster the core fuel distribution business  Sunoco completed the Sanford Oil buyout last August to distribute roughly 115 million gallons of fuel every year The wholesale distribution businesses that Sunoco had acquired in Ohio  Pennsylvania  West Virginia and New York in December 2018 have the capacity to transport roughly 180 million gallons of fuel every year  Moreover  during 2018 end  it had acquired two refined products terminal businesses located in North Texas and Arkansas  with around 77 500 barrels per day of total throughput as well as 1 3 million barrels of storage capacity  All these acquisitions are expected to be highly accretive to the unitholder s cash flows going forward As it is  the partnership is poised to gain from strong gasoline demand and rising consumption of diesel fuel  Notably  the partnership expects extensive fuel distribution operations to distribute fuel volumes of 8 8 2 billion gallons through 2019  higher than 7 9 billion gallons in 2018 Cost Discipline Aids Profit LevelsThe partnership is currently focused on reducing costs and expenses  This is expected to benefit its bottom line  It has managed to significantly reduce costs and expenses in the last few quarters  Total cost of sales and operating expenses declined 11 6  and 9 6  sequentially in fourth quarter 2018 and first quarter 2019  respectively  The trend is expected to continue  thereby helping the partnership in increasing profit levels in the coming quarters Notably  Sunoco beat estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters  with average positive surprise of 29 73   Per the Zacks model  the partnership expects year over year growth of 100  in 2019 earnings Wrapping UpConsidering the above mentioned factors  Sunoco   being one of the largest motor fuel distributors in the wholesale market in terms of volume   is likely to maintain share price momentum  While the partnership has not hiked distribution since mid 2016  Sunoco boasts a double digit yield of 10 19   higher than the industry s 8 7  However  one red flag that investors have to watch out for is the partnership s high leverage ratio of more than 79   While divestment and cost curtailment initiatives have shored up the balance sheet to some extent  the partnership still carries a considerable long term debt of  2 3 billion Nevertheless  we believe that strategic buyouts to boost the core fuel distribution business  and increasing consumption of gasoline and diesel will help the Zacks Rank  2  Buy  partnership to tide over the challenges and drive its performance further  You can see  Other Refining and Marketing MLPs to ConsiderOther top ranked stocks in the

3107,224622,CLFD,ViaSat  VSAT  Q4 Earnings Miss Despite Record Revenues,opinion,Following an impressive beat in the third quarter  ViaSat Inc  s   NASDAQ VSAT   fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results fell far short of expectations as its adjusted earnings  including stock based compensation adjustments  of 12 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents by a wide 45 5  The decline was due to a huge rise in operating costs  particularly in research and development  which more than offset the record top line GAAP earnings came in at 9 cents  tumbling 43 8  from 16 cents in the year ago quarter For fiscal 2016  the company reported GAAP earnings of 44 cents  down 47 6  from the fiscal 2015 figure of 84 cents Inside the HeadlinesThe company posted record revenues of  372 million for the quarter  led by robust growth in Satellite Services and Government Systems segments  Revenues came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  363 million and were up 2  year over year  Strong growth in these segments more than offset the decline in th commercial networks business For fiscal 2016  the company reported revenues of  1 417 4 million  up 2 5  Segment wise  Satellite Services revenues achieved a record high for the second consecutive quarter  up 11 5  year over year to  145 4 million  The impressive figures were driven by continued strength in residential broadband offerings and emerging in flight connectivity business However  Commercial Networks revenues continued to show weakness and tanked 26  on a year over year basis to  62 2 million  This was owing to the winding down of the NBN Co  infrastructure project in addition to the completion of certain antenna systems and mobile broadband satellite communications systems programs  However  these declines were somewhat offset by strength in initial broadband terminal orders under the NBN project On the other hand  Government Systems reported record revenues  which were up 9 3  to  164 4 million  The numbers were primarily fuelled by strong performance in government satellite communications systems products and tactical data link products sales  However  low revenues from information assurance products limited growth to some extent During the quarter  sales backlog increased 2 9  year over year to  941 9 million Adjusted EBIDTA fell 9 5  from the comparable quarter last year to

3111,224626,CLFD,Ericsson  ERIC  Report Shows Huge Potential In Wearables,opinion,"Communication technology and services giant Ericsson  ST ERICAs    NASDAQ ERIC   has released a new ConsumerLab Report  which focuses on wearable technology and the Internet of Things   IoT    and its demand projections in the future  The findings of its survey offer interesting insights to the future of wearables 
Most Desired Wearables Functions
With the demographic of wearable owners having evolved over the past few years  it seems that users are now younger and less concerned about fitness and health  According to the study  about 6 in 10 smartphone users are looking for more functionality from wearables  Specifically  consumers are showing great interestin devices that are related to personal safety and security  such as personal locators and panic buttons 
Other most desired wearables functions include smartwatches  identity authenticators and wearable water purifiers  according to the opinions given by 5 000 smartphone users surveyed across Brazil  China  South Korea  U K  and the U S  Among these consumers  about half use wearables 
Market Poised for Growth
It s almost a given that the wearables market is poised for tremendous growth in the coming years  Smartphone users who also own wearables have doubled over the past year in the surveyed markets 
Per a report from Transparency Market Research  the global wearable technology market stood at  750 0 million in 2012 and is expected to reach  5 8 billion in 2018  at a CAGR of 40 8  
Smartphones to Be Replaced 
Ercisson s report offers a peek at the market s potential beyond 2020  The report says that wearables will increasingly help consumers interact with physical things and objects  with 43  smartphone users believing that wearables might actually replace smartphones sometime in the future 
Wearables will gradually get smarter and more independent in terms of connectivity  and this might make the smartphone less significant  38  of smartphone users believe it likely that most smartphone functions will be performed by wearables within just five years 
About one third of the smartphone users expect to use at least five connected wearable devices by 2020 
Further  wearable technology will also help people connect to the IoT  and thus accelerate the convergence of the digital and human worlds 
About 60  of the users believe that ingestible pills and chips under the skin will be common in the coming five years  In addition to health monitoring  these might also be used to authenticate identity and transactions  unlock doors  and other such tasks In fact  a quarter of smartwatch owners are already using their smartwatches to control other digital devices remotely 
However  users expect that the current market wearables will take another year or so to become mainstream 
Risks in Wearables 
Also  all this wearable technology use gives rise to apprehension about safety and security of personal information and data  About 53  of users surveyed acknowledged that wearables are vulnerable to hacking  data breaches and viruses  Yet  60  think that they have complete control of their data 
To conclude  anything seems possible for this new technology  and most people seem to be on board with wearables becoming a part of their daily life

3115,224630,CLFD,Make Or Break Week For Q4 Earnings Season,opinion,"The picture emerging from the 2014 Q4 earnings season at this stage is one of weakness  with earnings and revenue growth rates tracking below levels that we have been seeing in other recent periods  Weak results from the Finance sector has been a big drag on the aggregate picture at this stage and the growth rates improve once Finance is excluded from the aggregate numbers  But aside from high proportion of companies beating EPS estimates  the results thus far don t compare favorably to the recent past  whether looked at with or without the Finance sector 
 The reporting cycle really accelerates this week  with almost 500 companies coming out with Q4 results  including 136 S P 500 members  This week s line up packs plenty of leaders from all the key sectors  ranging from Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  and Facebook  NASDAQ FB  to Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   Dupont  NYSE DFT   and much more in between  As such  it may not be unfair to characterize this week as a make or break week for the Q4 earnings season  This week will either fully confirm the weak start we have had thus far or turn it around in the opposite direction  But the trends established this week will carry through the rest of this reporting cycle with only minor changes The Q4 Scorecard  as of 1 23 2015  We have seen Q4 results from 91 S P 500 members that combined account for 25 5  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these companies are up  3 2  from the same period last year  with 73 6  beating EPS estimates  Total revenues are up  2 1  from the same period last year and 50 5  of them are coming ahead with top line estimates  The table below shows the current scorecard for the S P 500 index

This is a weaker performance than we have seen from the same group of companies in other recent quarters  The charts below compare the Q4 growth rates and beat ratios for these 91 companies with what we had seen from the same group of companies in other recent quarters  As you can see  the earnings and revenue growth rates are weaker than what we have been seeing in other recent quarters  With respect to positive surprises  they are more numerous for earnings and less so for revenues  The charts below compare the results thus far with what we have seen from the same group of companies in 2014 Q3 and the average for the preceding four quarters 

Finance has the most weightage in the results thus far  with Q4 reports from 52 1  of the sector s total market capitalization already out  Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are down  6 1  on  2 0  lower revenues  with 69 0  beating EPS estimates and 55 2  coming ahead of top line expectations  This is the weakest performance that we have seen from these Finance sector companies in other recent quarters  thanks to tough comparisons at Citigroup  NYSE C  and JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   Had it not been for Citigroup and J P  Morgan  the Finance sector earnings would be up  3 7  from the same period last year  The charts below compare the Finance sector results thus far with what we had seen from this same group of companies in other recent quarters  As you can see  more companies have beat EPS estimates compared to Q3 or the average of the last four quarters  but the growth rates are clearly on the low side 

Keeping the Finance sector out of the results thus far  total earnings for the rest of the S P 500 companies are up  9 8  on  3 8  higher revenues  This improved growth picture notwithstanding  it is still weaker relative to what we had seen from this same group of ex Finance companies in other recent quarters  The charts below present the aggregate data thus far on an ex Finance basis

Finance results are not doubt weak  but the Technology sector isn t doing much better either  With results from almost one quarter of the sector s total market cap already  total Tech sector earnings are up  2  on  2 5  lower revenues  with 80  beating EPS estimates and only 40  coming ahead of top line estimates  As you can see in the comparison charts below  this is weaker than what we have been seeing from these companies in other recent quarters 

Most of the sector results thus far have been the legacy old line Tech players like IBM  NYSE IBM   Intel  NASDAQ INTC   Oracle  NYSE ORCL  and others  This week brings in the  growthier  and more glamourous of the sector players like Facebook  Google and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   While the growth picture isn t expected to materially change  but we will know for sure only at the end of this week The Composite Q4 Picture Combining the actual results for the 91 S P 500 companies that have reported with the 409 still to come reports  total Q4 earnings are expected to be up  1 9  on  0 6  lower revenues  Four sectors   Transportation  Medical  Utilities and Business Services  are expected to have double digit earnings growth in Q4  while five sectors are expected to have lower total earnings this quarter relative to the year earlier period  The Energy sector has the weakest growth profile for understandable reasons  with total earnings for the sector expected to be down  24 6  on  16 0  lower revenues  The table below presents the summary picture for Q4 contrasted with what companies actually reported in the Q3 earnings season 

Falling Estimates Estimates for the current period  2015 Q1  have started coming down at an accelerated pace  with total earnings for the quarter now expected to be up  1 9   down from the  4  growth rate expected in mid December and  10 8  in early October  As was the case in Q4  Energy is the biggest driver of this negative revisions trend  While total Q1 earnings for the Energy sector were expected to be down  only   35 6  in mid December  they are now expected to be  56 6  year over year  Given the persistently weak oil prices  there is likely more room for downward adjustments to these estimates  Estimates for Q4 went through an even sharper negative revision process  though almost half of the drop in estimates was due to developments in the Energy sector  The chart below plots the evolution of current and following quarter estimates over the last 3 plus months  As you can see  the first half 2015 growth rate has effectively fallen victim to developments in the oil patch 

The Q4 Energy sector results that we have seen thus far are fairly strong  with total earnings for the 14 8  of the sector s market capitalization that have reported results are up  24 2  on  9 3  higher revenues  But this growth picture will look very different once Chevron  NYSE CVX  and ConocoPhillips report results this week  Exxon reports the following week  Note  Want more articles from this author  Scroll up to the top of this article and click the FOLLOW AUTHOR button to get an email each time a new article is published Note  For a complete analysis of 2014 Q4 estimates  please check out weekly  Here is a list of the 494 companies reporting this week  including 136 S P 500 members ",2015-01-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/make-or-break-week-for-q4-earnings-season-239538,239538

3141,224656,ARTX,U S  military marches forward on green energy  despite Trump,news,"By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump and his top advisors have often scoffed at government support of green energy  His chief strategist called it  madness   But the largest U S  government agency   the Department of Defense   plans to forge ahead under the new administration with a decade long effort to convert its fuel hungry operations to renewable power  senior military officials told Reuters  The reasons have nothing to do with the white hot debate over climate change  In combat zones  green energy saves lives by  for instance  reducing the need for easily attacked convoys to deliver diesel fuel to generators at U S  bases  Mobile solar power units allow soldiers to prowl silently through enemy territory   At sea  gas electric hybrid battleships save fuel and allow for fewer stops   making them less vulnerable to attacks like the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000  when al Qaeda militants killed 17 U S  soldiers during a refueling stop in Yemen  The military s zeal for renewable power has already had broad impacts on energy contractors  generating hundreds of millions in contracts for solar companies and helping to reduce fuel consumption by the world s largest single petroleum buyer   The armed forces nearly doubled renewable power generation between 2011 and 2015  to 10 534 billion British thermal units  or enough to power about 286 000 average U S  homes  according to a Department of Defense report  The number of military renewable energy projects nearly tripled to 1 390 between 2011 and 2015  department data showed  with a number of utilities and solar companies benefiting  Many of those projects are at U S  bases  where renewable energy allows the military to maintain its own independent source of power in case of a natural disaster or an attack   or cyber attack   that disables the public grid  The White House did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the military s use of green energy  Although Trump has blasted solar subsidies  vowed to boost fossil fuel development and questioned the science behind climate change  military leaders remain confident that the president won t halt their march toward renewable power    We expect that it s going to continue during the Trump administration   said Lt  Col  Wayne Kinsel  head of the infrastructure unit of the Air Force Asset Management Division for Logistics  Engineering and Force Protection   It s really not political   Other senior officials in the Navy  Air Force and Army also told Reuters that they expected their renewable energy programs to continue  Lt  Col  J B  Brindle  a Defense Department spokesman  said the agency  spends very little appropriated funding  on renewable energy projects  but declined to give any figures or to answer additional questions about such efforts   Trump s Secretary of Defense  Jim Mattis  has long supported efforts to reduce troop dependence on petroleum  He saw first hand the vulnerability of diesel convoys to attacks by militants while serving as Commander of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command in Afghanistan and Iraq in the early 2000s  As far back as 2003  he urged Navy researchers to find innovative ways to unleash the military from the  tether of fuel    LAUNCHED BY A REPUBLICAN The military s push into alternative energy started under Republican President George W  Bush in 2007  when he signed a law requiring the Pentagon to get 25 percent of the electricity for its buildings from renewable energy by 2025  The effort accelerated under President Barack Obama  who required the Army  Air Force and Navy to each deploy 1 gigawatt of renewable power and directed the Army to open a lab developing energy technologies for combat vehicles  In an apparent nod to Obama s efforts to curb global warming  the Pentagon also reported to Congress in 2015 that the droughts and floods caused by climate change pose a security threat   contributing to foreign political and economic instability that could require substantial troop deployments  Former Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in his parting memo in January that the Navy has already met its goal  producing 1 gigawatt of electricity   while the other forces are on track to meet their targets  The programs have their opponents  The conservative Heritage Foundation  for example  has railed against the military s support of renewable power and biofuels   The administration right now needs to focus specifically on combat power   said Rachel Zissimos  a Heritage researcher   Investing money on optional initiatives right now I think is problematic   HIGH STAKES FOR MILITARY SUPPLIERS Solar companies such as SunPower Corp  O SPWR  and utilities including  Sempra Energy   N SRE  and Southern  N SO  have won utility scale renewable energy contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years  according to the companies and Department of Defense documents reviewed by Reuters  Southern  N SO   for example  has 11 solar projects totaling 310 megawatts on bases in states including Georgia and Alabama  In December  Sempra  N SRE  completed the 150 megawatt Mesquite Solar 3 in Arizona to provide about a third of the power needed at 14 Navy and Marine bases in California for 25 years  SunPower has already landed a major deal under the Trump administration   a  96 million contract finalized on Feb  3 to provide power to Vandenberg Air Force base in California until 2043  according to a Pentagon database  Sempra and Southern said they were committed to serving their customers but declined to comment on whether they were discussing new contracts with the military  SunPower did not comment  Last year  the Navy began outfitting Arleigh Burke destroyers with gas electric hybrid engines developed by L3  N LLL   which won a  119 million contract in 2013  Tesla  O TSLA   which produces electric cars and batteries  is another company that analysts say could benefit from military contracts  A Tesla spokesman said the company is  supportive  of the military s interest in clean energy but declined comment on whether it was pursuing Defense Department contracts  The U S  military s use of oil  meanwhile  fell by more than 20 percent between 2007 and 2015  The bulk of the decline likely stems from declining combat operations rather than rising efficiency and use of renewable energy  But traditional military fuel suppliers   such as  Exxon Mobil   N XOM    BP   L BP   and Shell  L RDSa    nonetheless have a lot at stake if the military accelerates its move away from fossil fuels   For a graphic on Pentagon s oil purchases click   The military s average annual oil bill was about  14 28 billion between 2007 and 2015  BP is constantly reviewing its marketing strategies to ensure growth  a spokesman said   As fuel slates change  we will adapt  and continue to provide our customers with the products they demand   he said in response to questions about the potential impact of the military s increased use of renewable fuels   SOLAR POWERED SOLDIERS Hauling fuel to the battlefield has been a hazard for militaries since at least World War I and continues to take a grim toll  One in nearly 40 fuel convoys in Iraq in 2007 resulted in a death or serious injury  according to a study commissioned by the Defense Department  In Afghanistan the same year  one in 24 fuel convoys suffered casualties  Marines in Afghanistan began carrying solar panels in 2009 to forward bases in battles with Taliban fighters  They used them to power batteries for communications  GPS and night vision goggles  The panels not only reduced the need for convoys  they allowed marines to shut off generators  hushing operations and making them harder for enemies to detect  Arotech  ARTX  subsidiary UEC has sold  25 million worth of the solar arrays and expects a bigger business in systems working with batteries and solar to slash dependence on generators  said business manager Nancy Straight  Col  Brian Magnuson  the head of the Marines  expeditionary energy office  established in 2009  said his office aims to replace diesel powered generators on the battlefield with solar power  and to reduce energy use with efficiency measures such as insulated tents and the deployment of advanced batteries  
 These technologies are a way to become more effective in combat   Magnuson said   This is about war fighting capability    For a graphic on a boom in military green energy projects  click  ",2017-03-01,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/u.s.-military-marches-forward-on-green-energy,-despite-trump-462852",462852

the emergency currency potential and the establishment of the NMC  The former provision would have expired in 1914 but curiously  was used for the one and only time that year  However  Aldrich had packed his commission in June of 1908 with senators and representatives but  more significantly  powerful banking leaders  This junket headed for Europe in the fall  studying and gather information with heads of private European banks and central banks  They concluded European banking was more efficient and the European currencies had more gravitas compared to the dollar  By December   back in the U S   Aldrich added Paul Warburg and others to the inner circle  Charles A  Conant was chosen for  research and public relations   Warburg consulted with many academic economists at top tier universities  The American Bankers Association recommended a U S  Central bank along the lines of the German Reichsbank  Hesitant heads of national banks were assured the business model would not be adversely affected by the origin of a U S  Central bank  Regional banking districts in the country  under control of a central board  was a recommentation in November  1909  Throughout this whole era  the Morgan and Rockefeller banking interests had agreed to agree on a central bank  Yes  Incidentally  William Howard Taft was elected president  a friend of Aldrich and others since 1900  On September 14  1909  President Taft spoke in Boston and gave a big boost to the notion of a central bank  Wow  And a week later  The Wall Street Journal gave space to various op eds  unsigned  praising that great idea of  elastic currency  and other benefits  Actually  these letters were crafted by Charles Conant  He also recommended the regulation of interest rates by the central bank as a useful tool  The Washington Bureau of the Associate Press was also co opted  Another significant speech by Paul Warburg in New York on March 23  1910 impressed the Merchants  Association of New York  They had printed 30 000 copies of the transcript and distributed these far and wide  For public consumption  a monetary conference in New York in November 1910 presented a specific recommendations for a central bank and an appeal for all part of the country to support the Bill that Alrich would soon craft    The Private Railroad Car G  Edward Griffin  1  sets the scene at a New Jersey railroad station like the opening of a thriller movie  it s 10 p m  on November 22  1910 as a handful of important men board a private car  Unlike the numbered cars of the rest of this train  this one has no number  only a small plaque with the inscription  Aldrich   The senator greets his guests by first name only   and this rule is adhered throughout the trip and the week at Jekyll Island  Georgia  The private club on the island is part owned by J P  Morgan  The personnel lineup Senator Nelson P AldrichPaul Warburg  various banking connectionsAbraham Andrew  Assistant Secretary of the U S  TreasuryHenry P  Davison  senior partner  J P  Morgan Co Frank A  Vanderlip  president  National City Bank of New YorkCharles D  Norton  president  First National Bank of New YorkBenjamin Strong  head of Bankers Trust Co  The last two are questionable due to differing accounts in the  historical record  but both were in the Morgan camp  Aldrich  incidentally  was a financial partner of J P  Morgan  and also father in law of John D  Rockefeller  Jr   If Strong wasn t there  he surely knew about it   we will hear more of him  The public did indeed hear something of this secret meeting  but it was in 1935  The Saturday Evening Post carried an article by Vanderlip and the key takeaway was  If it were to be exposed publicly that our particular group had got together and written a banking bill  that bill would have had no chance whatever of passage by Congress    Warburg led the argument for a regional structure  presumably cognizant of public mistrust of too much power located in one area  Aldrich wanted an overt central bank with no political meddling  The compromise that was reached became the Aldrich Plan  introduced in Congress in 1912 and 1913   On November 5 6  2010  Ben Bernanke stayed on Jekyll Island to commemorate the 100 year anniversary of the original meeting   Alas  the Democrats won the 1912 elections resoundingly  The Republican Aldrich Plan seemed to fall by the wayside  Shiny new President Woodrow summoned a special session of Congress in April 1913  To seal the importance  he appeared in person  the first president since John Adams to do so  Wilson s address outlined various approaches to economic policies  banking and currency reform  tariffs  and the income tax  The 16th Amendment had been ratified on February 3  1913  Wilson needed that tax to support lower tariffs  A little bit of patronage pressure  and the Revenue Act of 1913 was passed by the House on May 8  1913  finally it went through the Senate on September 9  1913  Meanwhile  the Aldrich Plan was not dead  though that hated Republican name vanished  Representative Carter Glass  chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee  and Senator Robert Owen  chairman of the Senate s did a little tinkering here and there  Wilson mandated a central Federal reserve board be appointed by the president   with the consent of the Senate  There was one thorn in Wilson s side  his Secretary of State  William Jennings Bryan  The  Cross of Gold  person was still a power in the Democratic Party  The sop to Bryan was that Federal Reserve currency would be a liability of the government   and also  provision for federal loans to farmers  All this horse trading took time  though  and Wilson had other fish to fry during 1913  The 17th Amendment  Direct Election of U S  Senators   ratified and declared  became part of the Constitution on May 31  1913   Finally  months in the making  what started as the Glass Owen bill became the Federal Reserve Act of 1913  It passed the House on December 13 and the Senate  after an all nighter  on December 23  Wilson signed it that morning  A great year for the Populists  remember they wanted a graduated income tax  direct election of senatorsand before long  they got women s suffrage  19th Amendment   the eight hour work day  and restricted immigration    The Federal Reserve System  1914 and Beyond Aldrich had convened the Jekyll Island cabal but Warburg was the only expert on the European central bank model  Galbraith asserted that  Warburg has  with some justice  been called the father of the system   In the end  everybody won something  Aldrich s  decentralization  became the regional banks and avoidance of the term  bank  itself inevitably led to the Federal Reserve System nomenclature  And having the Federal Reserve Board in Washington  D C  implied  government   Smoke   mirrors  A decade later  the little Orphan Annie comic strip appeared  Did anyone recognize Daddy Warbucks  the self made billionaire doing good works with his wealth as an avatar of Paul Warburg  Anyway   Back in the day  the public story was that the Federal Reserve System would stabilize the economy  We ll see how that worked out  The real power of the System was   and is   the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  And who was offered the post of governor there  Benjamin Strong  Whether or not he was at Jekyll Island  there is no doubt he had influence  having been the personal auditor for J  P  Morgan  Sr  during the Panic of 1907  and also a long time friend of Henry Davidson  Paul Warburg became one of the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington  History has a droll way of throwing some unexpected crises   who would have imagined the assassination of an obscure archduke would lead to a worldwide conflagration  Well  that s the myth  anyhow  That the British mercantilist system might have been under threat from a foreign export power is unthinkiable as a cause for war  Isn t it  The outbreak of World War One had one immediate financial side effect  the New York Stock Market closed  Public anxiety was dispelled by the Secretary of the Treasury  using that dormant part of the Aldrich Vreeland Act  Emergency currency was available  by October 23  1914   368 616 990  In November  the 12 regional banks of the Federal Reserve System had opened and the emergency currency was withdrawn  The FRS was open for business  England and various European countries had been preparing for war for years  Armies were trained  alliances arranged  But when war occurred  England found itself fiscally bereft  John Pierpoint  Jack  Morgan  Jr  ruled the House of Morgan  his father having died in March  1913  Jack became the sales representative of British bonds and also the procurement officer for their needed war material  Nice profit on money going and coming  In 1915  President Wilson removed the ban on private bank lending to foreign allies  The House of Morgan immediately loaned  12 000 000 to Russia and  50 000 000 to France  Meanwhile  the first  12 000 000 British contract arrived  the first of many  The final total would be  3 000 000 000  Author John Moody  writing in 1919 summed it up  Not only did Britain and France pay for their supplies with money furnished by Wall Street  but they made their purchases through the same medium   Inevitably the House of Morgan was selected for this important task  Thus the war had given Wall Street an entirely new role  Hitherto it had been exclusively the headquarters of finance  now it became the greatest industrial mart the world had ever known  In addition to selling stock and bonds  financing railroads  and performing other tasks of a great banking centre  Wall Street began to deal in shells  cannon  submarines  blankets  clothing  shoes  canned meats  wheat  and the thousands of other articles needed for the prosecution of a great war  Large profits and small  A commission for selling  2 billion of Allied stock holdings to buy munitions  The sale of 4 400 000 rifles for  194 000 000  The House of Morgan was both buyer and seller  and no surprise that many of the purchase contracts went to businesses where Morgan was a shareholder  A reputation as war profiteer does attract some resentment  On July 3  1915 an intruder stole into Jack s Long Island mansion and shot him twice in the groin  Jack  however  survived  Great Britain  having burned through the Australian gold  from the 19th century gold rush there  found itself short of money to fund a war  It did the thing that is obvious to every politician  achieve fiat money by golng off the gold standard  Every other country in Europe did also  America maintained a gold standard but not redemption for foreign held dollars  By the end of the war  every country had inflated its money supply  Germany went eight times the pre war amount  This explains much of things to come    The Cunard Lines had turned over their record breaking Lusitania over to the Admiralty  The speedy ocean lined proved inadvisable to refit into an auxiliary cruiser due to operational expense  910 tons of coal a day    so it was ordered to continue passenger  and mail  service  On April  22 1915  the German embassy ordered advertisements in 50 U S  newspapers  advising prospective passengers that an Atlantic crossing went through a war zone  the seas around the British Isles   Many of these advertisements were never published   On May 1  1915  the Lusitania set out on its final voyage to Liverpool  England  Little did the passengers know there was a hidden cargo of munitions and other material for the British war effort  At this point in time  the German navy followed the code of limited submarine warfare  Neutral vessels were off limits  At 1420 hours on May 6  the commander of the U 20  Walther Schwieger  fires one torpedo at a target  Torpedo hits starboard side right behind the bridge  An unusually heavy detonation takes place with a very strong explosive cloud  The explosion of the torpedo must have been followed by a second one  boiler or coal or powder    The ship stops immediately and heels over to starboard very quickly  immersing simultaneously at the bow  the name Lusitania becomes visible in golden letters  U20 log The Lusitania sank in only 18 minutes  Few lifeboats were properly launched due to the extreme starboard list  Of 1 959 passengers and crew  1 195 perish  including 128 Americans  Several official inquiries were convened that created enough obfuscation to keep tinfoil hat manufacturers busy to this very day  Prevented testimony  state secrets  crew statements in identical handwriting with similar phrasing  definitely one  no  two  or was it three torpedos  Some closed hearings  other open with no access to some evidence  Two sets of Admiralty papers  depending on the type of hearing  Perjury  At any rate  Wilson s immediate response was three diplomatic notes to Germany  strong  stronger  ultimatum  After the second  Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan resigned in protest  Nonetheless  the American public had been fired up  just not enough for war  The British were already hinting that  should they lose the war  they would never be able to repay their debt to America  In early 1916  President Wilson sent his personal adviser   Colonel  Edward Mandell House to London  And why not   House was the shadow power that had arranged Wilson s nomination for president  House even had two rooms at the White House  And while Wilson sought re election on the slogan  he kept American out of war   his adviser consulted with British foreign office officials  notably Sir Edward Grey  Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan had not be told of this unofficial arrangement  nonetheless  he was not stupid  Mary Baird Bryan  co author  The Memoris of William Jennings Bryan  While Secretary Bryan was bearing the heavy responsibility of the Department of State  there arose the curious conditions surrounding Mr  E M House s unofficial connection with the President and his voyages abroad on affairs of State  which were not communicated to Secretary Bryan   The President was unofficially dealing with foreign powers  U S  Ambassador Walter Hines Page  House arrived    with  the idea of American intervention   a minimum programme of peace   the least the Allies would accept  which  he assumed  would be unacceptable to the Germans  we should plunge into the War  not on the merits of the cause  but by a carefully sprung trick   memorandum  February 9  1916  On March 9  1916  President Wilson sanctioned the secret agreement with England and France for the United States of intervene on behalf of the Allies  It seems Wilson and House believed the worthy end  of world peace and a world government  lay through the means of war  They had help  Assistant Secretary of the Navy Roosevelt  the Franklin Delano  urged arming merchant ships in violation of neutrality  And time passed with America on the sidelines and the Allies accusing Wilson of dragging his feet  Maybe they didn t understand the U S  election cycle  The attitude of the British public toward America was  too proud or too scared  and they termed unexploded shells on the front line as  wilsons   Both British and German propaganda served to inflame the American public over the next months  Wilson was narrowly re elected in 1916  A tipping point happened when Germany attempted to enlist Mexico as an ally  following their new policy  Of unrestricted submaine warfare  This threated American commercial shipping  On April 2  1917 in his message to Congress  Wilson spoke of armed neutrality no longer working   enemies against us at our very doors   unsuspecting communities   and offices of government with spies   criminal intrigues    and a warning  disloyalty  will be dealt with a firm hand of repression   And finally  the world must again be safe for democracy  With fifty representatives and six senators opposted  a declaration of war was passed by Congress on April 4  1917 and signed by Wilson the April 6  Behind the scenes during this period  the Federal Reserve went into full operation in 1915  They played a significant role in financial Allied and U S  War efforts  with some help   Wilson furthered Democratic values with the agricultural Smith Lever Act of 1914 and the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916  He also thwarted a national transportation shutdown by guiding the Adamson Act through Congress which instituted the eight hour day  Then there was the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918  A firm hand  yes  Anarchists  Wobblies  communists  anti war activists  and even newspaper editors were grist for the DoJ mill  Deportation of recent immigrants who opposed the war came with the Immigration Act of 1918  Then there was Wilson s Committee of Public information  the first official propaganda office  Wilson s League of Nations concept came via a speech on January 8  1918  his Fourteen Points    Liberty Bonds We have a war  And on April 24  the 1917 Emergency Loan Act initiated the first of four bond issues  Buy Liberty Bonds  It s a patriotic duty  A limit of  5 billion was set   2 billion were sold  The second  third and forth issues appeared in  respectively  October 1 1917  April 5  1918  and September 28  1918  A poor response to the bonds was met by the Treasury with a sales campaign promoted by Hollywood stars  Boy Scouts  and even a special Army Air Corps elite group that travelled the country  Buy a bond and get to ride in a JN 4 airplane  Incidentally  that 1917 act is the tool by which U S  Treasury bonds are issued to this very day  We will re visit the fourth Liberty Bond issue in fifteen years  The active  war to end war  ended on November 11  1918 with a cease fire  The Treaty of Versailles was signed on June 28  1919 ,2012-01-27,Jim

3165,224680,AMSF,Aflac  AFL  Hits New 52 Week High  Is Further Upside Left ,opinion,"On May 10  2019  shares of Aflac Inc    NYSE AFL   scaled a 52 week high of  51 36  The rally in the stock is believed to have been due to its sustained profitable operating performance along with a favorable guidance that further points to strong results 
In a year s time  the stock has gained 13  compared with the  s growth of 9   The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a Value Score of B  Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  offer the best opportunities in the value investing space 
The stock has witnessed a 1 8  and 1 1  upward revision in earnings estimates for 2019 and 2020  respectively What s Favoring the Stock Strength in its U S and Japan business has driven revenue growth at Aflac  The company continues to gain from its industry leading market share in both the regions  A diverse and productive distribution network has contributed to the company s premium growth  Innovative products and customized and high quality services have helped it to attract new clients and retain the existing ones A strong capital position along with stable earnings and cash flow provides strength to the company and allows for strategic investments 
Will the Rally Continue 
Last year  Aflac successfully changed its Japan business from a branch to a subsidiary  Japan has been a significant business generator for the company  This change in operating structure better aligns Aflac with the global regulatory framework 
It also recently entered into an agreement with Japan Post per which the latter will buy 7  of the company s shareholding   This deal is expected to drive business expansion in the region  thus aiding overall growth 
The company has suffered from low interest rates in Japan and has changed the product mix to emphasize sale of third sector products  which are less prone to interest rate volatility    
Though Aflac anticipates that in its Japan business  total earned premium of third sector and first sector protection products combined will slightly decline due to limited pay policies reaching paid up status and sales are expected to decline in low to mid single digits for 2019  the long term picture remains bright In its U S business  the company continues to put up a good show  with continuous growth in premiums since past several years  It has undertaken a number of growth initiatives in this segment such as the adoption of Everwell and One Pay Day for increased penetration  delivery of value added services and increased client retention  product partnering to drive improved account values and employee access  and investment in administrative capabilities 
Per the company  investments made in distribution and customer experience will promote increased productivity  persistency  and improved long term economics  In 2019  the company expects  improvement in sales and 2 3  growth in earned premium      
Aflac s strong risk adjusted capital position is another positive  The company has raised dividends for 37 consecutive years and its current yield of 2 2  is higher than the industry average of 0 5   The stock is known as dividend aristocrat and is viewed attractively by dividend seeking investors 
Given that the company s favorable operating performance is likely to continue  we see dividend growth to remain on track   The above factors are expected to fuel Aflac s stock rally 
Other Stocks to Consider
Other stocks worth considering are Employers Holdings  Inc    NYSE EIG    Amerisafe  Inc    NASDAQ AMSF   and CNA Financial Corp    NYSE CNA    While Employers Holdings sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   the other two stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Employers and Amerisafe  each have surpassed estimates in all four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 78 3  and 26 6   respectively  CNA Financial surpassed estimates in the last reported quarter by 12 5

Arotech Corporation CEO s Comments

 Arotech concluded a transformative 2016 with further cost saving measures at both the corporate and division level   commented acting CEO Dean Krutty    Our Board of Directors helped drive the reduction in our cost structure with the recently negotiated separation agreement of our former CEO  which followed our previously announced decision to discontinue our Flow Battery business  We will continue to pursue streamlining our operations and our corporate cost structure in line with our commitment to bring better returns to shareholders  
 At the same time  it should be noted that we have accelerated our investment in the fourth quarter into one of our most promising business areas  the hybrid power segment of our UEC subsidiary in South Carolina  The promise of this equipment as a solution for Department of Defense initiatives to reduce fuel dependence for forward deployed soldiers and marines motivates us to remain the industry leader in hybrid power technologies  We believe that this investment and others  will lead to substantially improved results for this unit beginning in 2018   

ARTX Technical Analysis

ARTX opened  yesterday at  4 00 which was up from the previous day s trading close of  3 95  Shares closed trading yesterday at  4 10 and spiked down after market to  3 50  equivalent to a 14  decrease from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that the last time ARTX traded below these levels we have to go all the way back to January 3rd  when it traded at  3 50 
Taking a closer look at the  we can see that before the spike down ARTX had already been in an overall downward trend dating back to January 20th when it traded at  5 00  ARTX has a float of 19 59 million shares and traded 1 64 times the normal daily trading volume on Wednesday 
For trading purposes  I would like to see ARTX open trading on Thursday below  3 70 and if it does I would be looking to take a short position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 08 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap down

marked the ninth anniversary of the U S  stock market s bull run after the grueling slump following the Great Recession  Since then  stocks have scaled new heights on the latest Republican tax cuts and robust economic growth at home and abroad In the meantime  rate hike and inflation fears failed to impede the rally  Investors also breathed a sigh of relief after the recent trade war fears on Trump s tariffs plan eased  This calls for investing in some rock solid stocks that have not only outperformed in the current bull market but also have scope to scale higher Bull Market Celebrates 9th BirthdayU S  stocks bottomed on Mar 9  2009  with the S P 500 losing more than 50  to hit a low of 676 53  The selloff had provoked President Barack Obama to say that  what you re now seeing is profit and earnings ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal if you ve got a long term perspective on it  Since then  the benchmark index has more than tripled  marking the second longest and second highest bull market run in its history  This record is second to the bull run that stretched through the 1990s The Dow also went past the coveted 20 000 mark in late January and then blew past the 21 000 threshold just a month later  The bull market has helped the blue chip index scale a whopping 14 300 points Stocks Outshine Other InvestmentsDuring the nine years of the bull market  U S  stocks handily beat other investments including gold and real estate  U S  stocks also easily outdid their European counterparts  U S  large cap stocks have given a return of around 325  since Mar 9  2009  This means that the investor who had  100 000 in a fund tracking large cap stocks  will now have an account balance of about  425 000 Gold  in the meanwhile  has climbed only 43  from  925 per ounce in March 2009 to the current  1 325  per the World Gold Council  This means an investment of  100 000 in gold is now worth  143 000 The return on investments in U S  homes have only risen 19  from March 2009 to February 2018  according to Zillow s Home Value Index  Thus  the price of an American home has moved up from  175 000 to  208 000 in the last nine years Meanwhile  the Europe Stoxx 600  a broad index of large European stocks  jumped 135  during the same time frame  Such gains boosted a  100 000 investment to  235 000  less than half of U S  large cap stocks Catalysts Behind the Bull MarketThe bull run was no fluke  since the current stock prices are well supported by the Trump induced rally  Trump s polices including tax cuts  repealing regulations and increased infrastructure outlays restored expectations of a pro growth agenda that helped the broader market push further into record territory The new tax laws give companies a massive tax break as they will be paying between 8  and 15 5  instead of the earlier 35  to bring back money from overseas  This means around  1 2 trillion in foreign profits that the S P 500 companies are sitting on will be returned  This in turn can be used to create jobs and reward shareholders   something the Trump administration has been aiming for since the election campaigns  read more    Trump s economy also started 2017 on a stellar note  The U S  economy expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 3  last year  marking the best growth in two years  Also  Americans are getting fatter paychecks  with wages growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade  read more    But  there is another major factor behind the strong American growth  It s the global economic growth  with every major country from China to Europe and Latin America to Japan expanding at a healthy pace  According to the International Monetary Fund  the global economy expanded at rate of 3 7  last year  the fastest since 2010 A healthier global economy  in turn  lifted corporate profits  In fact  for full year 2017  total S P 500 index earnings are expected to be up 7 1  on 5 9  higher revenues  way higher than the 0 7  earnings growth on 2 2  higher revenues recorded in 2016  read more    Bull Market to Stay  5 WinnersThe tax overhaul policy  solid global economic growth and encouraging earnings picture have certainly helped dismiss the fear that the Federal Reserve embarking on a quicker route to interest rate hikes might derail the record bull run  Odds of a trade war  in the meantime  ebbed after Trump exempted Canada and Mexico from steel and aluminum tariffs and allowed other countries to negotiate exclusions Ryan Detrick  senior market strategist at LPL Financial  further said that since 1950  if the S P 500 increases 5  or more in January  the full year returns are always positive  Needless to say  the benchmark index nudged up 5 6  in January

3199,224714,CENT,5 Top Stocks To Buy As Bull Market Turns Nine,opinion,Mar 9 marked the ninth anniversary of the U S  stock market s bull run after the grueling slump following the Great Recession  Since then  stocks have scaled new heights on the latest Republican tax cuts and robust economic growth at home and abroad In the meantime  rate hike and inflation fears failed to impede the rally  Investors also breathed a sigh of relief after the recent trade war fears on Trump s tariffs plan eased  This calls for investing in some rock solid stocks that have not only outperformed in the current bull market but also have scope to scale higher Bull Market Celebrates 9th BirthdayU S  stocks bottomed on Mar 9  2009  with the S P 500 losing more than 50  to hit a low of 676 53  The selloff had provoked President Barack Obama to say that  what you re now seeing is profit and earnings ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal if you ve got a long term perspective on it  Since then  the benchmark index has more than tripled  marking the second longest and second highest bull market run in its history  This record is second to the bull run that stretched through the 1990s The Dow also went past the coveted 20 000 mark in late January and then blew past the 21 000 threshold just a month later  The bull market has helped the blue chip index scale a whopping 14 300 points Stocks Outshine Other InvestmentsDuring the nine years of the bull market  U S  stocks handily beat other investments including gold and real estate  U S  stocks also easily outdid their European counterparts  U S  large cap stocks have given a return of around 325  since Mar 9  2009  This means that the investor who had  100 000 in a fund tracking large cap stocks  will now have an account balance of about  425 000 Gold  in the meanwhile  has climbed only 43  from  925 per ounce in March 2009 to the current  1 325  per the World Gold Council  This means an investment of  100 000 in gold is now worth  143 000 The return on investments in U S  homes have only risen 19  from March 2009 to February 2018  according to Zillow s Home Value Index  Thus  the price of an American home has moved up from  175 000 to  208 000 in the last nine years Meanwhile  the Europe Stoxx 600  a broad index of large European stocks  jumped 135  during the same time frame  Such gains boosted a  100 000 investment to  235 000  less than half of U S  large cap stocks Catalysts Behind the Bull Market The bull run was no fluke  since the current stock prices are well supported by the Trump induced rally  Trump s polices including tax cuts  repealing regulations and increased infrastructure outlays restored expectations of a pro growth agenda that helped the broader market push further into record territory The new tax laws give companies a massive tax break as they will be paying between 8  and 15 5  instead of the earlier 35  to bring back money from overseas  This means around  1 2 trillion in foreign profits that the S P 500 companies are sitting on will be returned  This in turn can be used to create jobs and reward shareholders   something the Trump administration has been aiming for since the election campaigns  read more    Trump s economy also started 2017 on a stellar note  The U S  economy expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 3  last year  marking the best growth in two years  Also  Americans are getting fatter paychecks  with wages growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade  read more    But  there is another major factor behind the strong American growth  It s the global economic growth  with every major country from China to Europe and Latin America to Japan expanding at a healthy pace  According to the International Monetary Fund  the global economy expanded at rate of 3 7  last year  the fastest since 2010 A healthier global economy  in turn  lifted corporate profits  In fact  for full year 2017  total S P 500 index earnings are expected to be up 7 1  on 5 9  higher revenues  way higher than the 0 7  earnings growth on 2 2  higher revenues recorded in 2016  read more    Bull Market to Stay  5 Winners The tax overhaul policy  solid global economic growth and encouraging earnings picture have certainly helped dismiss the fear that the Federal Reserve embarking on a quicker route to interest rate hikes might derail the record bull run  Odds of a trade war  in the meantime  ebbed after Trump exempted Canada and Mexico from steel and aluminum tariffs and allowed other countries to negotiate exclusions Ryan Detrick  senior market strategist at LPL Financial  further said that since 1950  if the S P 500 increases 5  or more in January  the full year returns are always positive  Needless to say  the benchmark index nudged up 5 6  in January Banking on such positives  we have selected five solid stocks that have outperformed in the current bull market and have

per share of 36 cents came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The figure rose 12 5  over the prior year quarter tally  as top line growth and higher gross margin boosted profits    GAAP net earnings for the quarter came in at  42 6 million  significantly higher than the year ago quarter s tally of  1 1 million Inside the HeadlinesThe company s top line grew a remarkable 7 2  year over year to  406 8 million  However  revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  408 million by a whisker  Recent acquisitions and several product launches in existing businesses bolstered the top line Phenomenal growth in the company s OEM   Emerging Markets segment and strength in the Detection segment drove the overall top line  and more than offset the decline in sales experienced in the four remaining segments As for the segments  OEM   Emerging Markets revenues continued their striking growth trajectory  rising an impressive 77 2  over the prior year quarter to  84 8 million  whileDetection revenues recorded growth of 8 7  year over year to  31 8 million  The revenues of OEM   Emerging Markets were partially driven by the addition of the Integrated Imaging Solutions line of business from the recent acquisition of Point Grey Research However  all other segments reported a decline in sales Maritime segment revenues were down 6 1  year over year to  48 6 million Surveillance segment revenues also contracted 4 4  year over year to  118 7 million In addition  Instruments revenues had another quarter of decline  decreasing 2  year over year to  77 9 million Revenues from the Security segment also had a disappointing performance this quarter  falling 4 2  over the prior year quarter to  45 1 million FLIR Systems  backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next 12 months came in at  608 million  reflecting an increase of 3  from the tally at the end of year ago quarter Adjusted operating income came in at  69 6 million compared with  62 2 million in the prior year quarter  Sturdy top line growth drove the rise in income Liquidity   Cash FlowAs of Mar 31  2017  the company s cash and cash equivalents were  397 4 million compared with  361 3 million a year back  Long term debt fell to  494 7 million compared with  501 9 million as at Dec 31  2016 Cash flow generated from operating activities in the quarter came in at  75 1 million  significantly higher than  45 9 million generated in the year earlier quarter  The rise can be largely attributed to sustained improvements in productivity of working capital FLIR Systems  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Dividend   Share RepurchaseConcurrent with the earnings report  FLIR Systems announced a quarterly cash dividend of 15 cents per share  payable on Jun 9  2017  to

1 81  1 91 per share  on revenues of  1 78  1 83 billion  The figures represent year over year growth of about 7 13  in adjusted earnings and 7 10  growth in revenues In fact  the company expects to see an uptick in organic growth second quarter onwards Going ForwardFLIR Systems has been expanding its market share in nearly all of its served markets  The company anticipates to build up on the strong backlog going ahead in 2017  Also  it has several new product platforms in the pipeline  which it expects to launch this year  which should drive growth In addition  the company s improved working capital utilization is resulting in robust cash flow that supplements its strength However  some of the company s segments are currently under pressure  which might continue to hurt the company s operations  Moreover  profitability of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company depends on its ability to check the rise in costs during the second half of the year  You can see  FLIR Systems

3201,224716,ARTX,Arotech Corporation Shares Fall as Company Posts First Quarter Loss,opinion,"Arotech Corporation  NASDAQ ARTX 
Arotech Corporation  ARTX   a global company that provides defense and security products yesterday reported their first quarter 2017 financial results  Arotech Corporation reported first quarter loss of  786k   Arotech Corporation reported first quarter adjusted earnings of  0 01 per share  Arotech Corporation reported first quarter revenues of  22 3 million 
Arotech Corporation CEO s Comments

 Arotech s first quarter 2017 results  as anticipated  include revenue for the quarter that was less than a year ago  though better than the previous quarter  The engineering based development programs we are currently executing have required us to add engineering staff in both of our US operations to meet demand  but are absent the typical hardware components that help to immediately drive higher revenues   said acting Arotech CEO Dean Krutty 
 We continued to invest in the quarter in important hybrid power developments  bringing our total investment over the last five quarters to more than a million dollars in this technology  which we expect to be very meaningful to our future  Additionally  our contributions to the US Marine Corps  Amphibious Assault Vehicle Survivability Upgrade program during the quarter supported important test milestones that have led to the beginning of low rate initial production   

ARTX Technical Analysis
Arotech Corporation Chart
ARTX opened trading yesterday at  3 25 which exactly the same as the previous day s trading close  ARTX closed trading yesterday at  3 30 and crashed down after market to  3 05  equivalent to a 8  decrease from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that the last time ARTX traded below these levels we have to go back to April 26th when it traded at  3 00 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike down ARTX had already been in an overall downward trend dating back to January 20th when it traded at  5 00  ARTX has a float of 21 81 million shares and traded below the normal daily trading volume on Monday 
For trading purposes  I would like to see ARTX open trading on Tuesday below  3 12 and if it does I would be looking to take a short position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 05 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap down

3211,224726,AMSF,4 Solid Insurance Stocks To Hit High Spots In Q4 Bull Market,opinion,Despite the volatile operating environment  with the occurrence of natural calamities  regulatory changes  Federal Reserve s decision as to when hike the interest rate again  there have been quite a few insurance companies which have delivered better than expected results in the third quarter of 2017 Even though the aforementioned challenges are anticipated to impact the upcoming quarter  we remain optimistic about the operational performance of such insurance companies in the near term We will discuss some driving factors that should help insurance companies to perform better in the impending quarter  raising optimism among investors Rising Interest Rates   A Much Awaited Boon to InsurersIf we focus on the life insurance industry  we can identify its connection with interest rates  given the high sensitivity of the players  business models to interest rates  Therefore  life insurance industry s heavy dependence on investment income will benefit most companies from the rising interest rate environment  Thus  rising interest rates as well as increase in bond yields will provide a required relief to insurers to maintain margins Although the Federal Reserve has left the interest rates unchanged  following the Federal Open Market Committee s meeting on Sep 20  2017  ranging between 1  and 1 25   the life insurers are still looking forward to another interest rate hike this year  indicated by policymakers at the meeting  Interestingly  the Fed committee also expects to raise interest rates thrice in 2018  Hence  the overall industry pins hope on the investment income growth in the immediate term  This in turn might also help strengthen its market position A progressing rate environment will lessen the burden on life insurers  investment income  boosting their earnings  This will additionally  accelerate the insurance companies  overall rise in the future Other Aspects Likely to Boost Future PerformanceContinued growth in premiums and a better control over underwriting expenses are anticipated to lend a substantial boost to life insurers  income in the quarter ahead  The individual life insurance premiums  which witnessed modest growth over a considerable period of time  will likely continue the trend with rising demand  driven by an improving job market and the aging population  for retirement savings  Interestingly  life insurers are increasingly moving toward redesigned and re priced products with potential to enhance their liability profiles and profitability in the upcoming quarter Moreover  stronger corporate bonds and improving real estate market might help curtail the credit related investment losses  Also  bettering economy and higher inflation induced bonds look to yield good returns to investors  Life insurers are expected to gain from this favorable trend if it continues in the long run  In fact  a flourishing economy indicates more disposable income with people opting for more insurance coverage Further  the demand for life insurance is estimated to improve and fortify on the back of customers  need for greater safety in a volatile financial environment  Per a recent report by the worldwide insurance association  Life Insurance Management Research Association  LIMRA   minimum 34  of Americans are likely to buy life insurance in 2017  This will in fact encourage demand for life insurance with the industry reaping benefits from such an upside   Key PicksDespite challenging market conditions and evolving customer

3216,224731,AMSF,Is Amerisafe  AMSF  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Amerisafe  Inc    NASDAQ AMSF   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Amerisafe has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 4  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 5  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Amerisafe s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint  which is 15 5  over the past five years However  the stock s PE also compares unfavorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers Moreover  we should also point out that Amerisafe has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 18 7  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future    P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Amerisafe has a P S ratio of about 3 1  This is marginally lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Amerisafe currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes AMSF a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 12 1  which is slightly better than the industry average of 12 4  Clearly  AMSF is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Amerisafe might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B  This gives AMSF a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The full year 2017 has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days  compared to none lower  while the full year 2018 estimate has seen a similar trend in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the full year 2017 consensus estimate has inched up 0 6  in the past two months  while the full year 2018 estimate has risen about 6 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below AMERISAFE  Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAmerisafe is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a formidable industry rank  top 4  out of more than 250 industries  and top Zacks Rank  Amerisafe looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks Editor in Chief Goes  All In  on This Stock Full disclosure  Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other  He believes in its short term profit potential and also in its prospects to

3222,224737,CENT,Whirlpool To Gain From Growth Initiatives  Risks Persist,opinion,Whirlpool Corporation   NYSE WHR   has been gaining momentum lately on the back of its stringent focus on long term goals for 2020  innovation strategy as well as global cost based pricing and fixed cost reduction strategies  However  higher raw material inflation and lower volumes remain impediments Notably  shares of Whirlpool have gained 3  in the past six months against the  s decline of 11 7   Let s analyze the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock Long Term Goals  A Key Growth DriverWhirlpool is gaining significantly from its commitment toward long term goals supported by its robust product pipeline  solid innovations and cost productivity initiatives  Also  the company has outlined significant long term targets through 2020 driven by brand strength and product portfolio Through 2020  Whirlpool aims to deliver organic revenue growth of 3 5  annualy  Moreover  the company targets EBIT margin to exceed 10  by 2020 and envisions earnings per share to grow by 10 15  each year  By 2018  it anticipates free cash flow generation of 5 6  of revenues Cost Productivity Programs Aid MarginsWhirlpool is striving to improve margin through several measures including cost based price increments and cost reduction initiatives  which should also boost business efficiency  The company recently introduced global cost based pricing for its trade customers in order to mitigate raw material inflation  Furthermore  it is on track with initiatives to cut down fixed overhead expenses by  150 million  which will add to the company s ongoing cost productivity program Also  Whirlpool s focus on boosting consumer demand has increased global price mix by 50 basis points  bps  in fourth quarter 2017  This marked the company s first quarter of positive global price mix since fourth quarter 2015 In 2018  Whirlpool s positive global price mix along with significant progress on cost saving initiatives is likely to result in margin expansion  Additionally  the company s renewed focus on inventory management is expected to boost earnings and free cash flow going forward Innovation Driving GrowthWhirlpool is among one of those companies that have successfully implemented its innovation strategies into the business model  It invests heavily in technologies to produce differentiated products to suit the needs of their end consumers  Also  the company is keen on boosting revenues at its core appliance business through expansions and investments  This  in turn  is expected to fuel growth of its high margin categories Bottom LineWhile all seems well with Whirlpool  it has been suffering from soft top line performance and higher raw material inflation  Notably  the company s top line has lagged estimates for three straight quarters now  Moreover  Whirlpool s operating performance continues to be impacted by raw material cost inflation and unit volume declines  This caused adjusted operating margin to contract 70 bps in the preceding quarter Though the company expects improved global price mix and cost savings to benefit margins in 2018  this is likely to be more than offset by continued raw material inflation  In 2018  Whirlpool aniticipates the combined 125 bps margin improvement from favorable price mix  fixed cost reduction and improved cost productivity  to be more than offset by nearly  200  250 million increase in raw material inflation from the prior year Nonetheless  Whirlpool s ongoing strategic initiatives and cost savings

3223,224738,AMSF,Aflac  AFL  Hits New 52 Week High  Is More Upside Left ,opinion,"Shares of Aflac Inc    NYSE AFL   scaled a 52 week high of  91 3 on Jan 9  eventually closing a tad lower at  90  The gain is believed to be driven by the positive impact of the recently signed tax reform 
What Aided the Price Rise
The company recently announced that it will invest  250 million in different areas such as employee welfare  business growth and provide support to childhood cancer initiatives 
This development follows the recent passage of the tax reform by Donald Trump  which cuts the corporate tax rate to 21  from 35   Per management  this easy tax regime provides it an opportunity to make investments like the latest one 
Moreover  for its U S workforce  Aflac intends to make better retirement benefits by increasing the company s 401 k  match from 50  to 100  on the first 4  of employee s contribution while making a one time contribution of  500 to every employee s 401 k  plan  It will also offer certain hospital and accident insurance products to all employees free of charge as the company currently does with its core cancer insurance products 
On the business growth front  the company plans to invest in the technology and digital businesses like Empowered   a subsidiary of Aflac 
Share Price Performance
Aflac s stock has gained 29 6  in a year s time  outperforming its  s growth of 21 5  

Is Further Upside Left 
This Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock continues to suffer from 
Conversion Costs  Aflac is in the process of converting its Japan branch into a subsidiary  This  in turn  will enhance its business development flexibility  In fact  the  company has booked approximately  24 million in pretax costs associated with its Japan branch conversion in the first nine months of 2017 
The conversion remains on track and the company expects to incur conversion costs of  120 million to  130 million pretax through mid 2018  These costs will hurt the company s margins in the coming quarters 
Pressure on Business in Japan  Aflac s top line remains sufficiently exposed to a challenging operating environment  primarily in Japan  which contributes nearly 70  of the company s revenues  The persistent low interest rate environment has led the company to deemphasize sales of first sector  life insurance  products in the region 
The curtailment of these products as well as weakening of yen has led to a decline in revenues by 0 3  in 2016 and 5 7  in the first nine months of 2017  Going forward  the restriction on sale of first sector products  which carry higher premiums along with currency volatility are further expected to suppress top line growth in the region   
Forex Volatility  The company s significant exposure to Japan makes its vulnerable to foreign currency volatility  Evidently  Aflac s earnings have been hampered by the alarming weakening of the Japanese yen relative to the U S  dollar for the past many years 
While foreign currency adversely impacted bottom line by 34 cents in 2016  the weaker yen dollar exchange rate hurt operating earnings per diluted share by 8 cents in the first nine months of 2017  Currency volatility is expected to continue affecting earnings in the coming quarters 
Overvalued  Aflac s valuation looks stretched at the current level  The company currently has a trailing 12 month price to book  P B  ratio of 1 6  near its highest range  The ratio is also higher than the P B ratio of 1 4 for the industry 
Based on the above mentioned factors  we believe the stock will remain under pressure in the near term 
Stocks to Consider
