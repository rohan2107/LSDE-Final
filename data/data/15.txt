0,221515,NIO,Why Shares of Chinese Electric Car Maker NIO Are Flying High Today,news,"What s happening
Shares of Chinese electric car maker NIO  NYSE NIO  were sharply higher on Wednesday morning after a Chinese business news outlet reported that the cash strapped company had secured new financing from a major automaker  As of 12 p m  EST  NIO s American depositary shares  ADS  were up about 16  from Tuesday s closing price 
So what
According to a report from Chinese business news site Sina Finance that cites a person familiar with the matter  NIO will soon receive a cash infusion of about  1 billion from Guangzhou based GAC Group  OTC GNZUF    At press time  neither NIO nor GAC had confirmed    or denied    the report  

GAC is one of China s big domestic automakers  It has significant joint ventures with Honda Motor and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  among others  If GAC has in fact decided to make a major investment in NIO    and as of now  neither company has confirmed the report    then NIO s future is bright  
That s an important development  In its 15 months as a public company  NIO has seen rising sales and strong customer loyalty  but its rapidly declining cash has called its future into question  As of Sept  30  the company had just  274 3 million remaining  down from  1 123 billion on March 31 
Now what
If this report is accurate and if the deal closes  then it s extremely bullish for NIO    but I think that auto investors should tread a bit carefully here  Note that an earlier bailout deal fell through at the last minute because of concerns about the company s viability  Use caution with this one ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pigqi,2060327

11,221526,NIO,Will Trade War And Controversies Thwart Tesla s Growth ,opinion,The young and flamboyant face of Tesla has dulled lately  The northward movement of its growth has been obstructed by both external and internal factors  The nagging U S  China trade war and rising tariffs are hampering Tesla s profits from international markets  What s more  the frequent controversial tweets by its CEO have made Tesla  share price volatile Will it now be possible for the magnificent electronic car maker to reap profits given that its peers are catching up fast Impact of U S  Sino Trade WarThe electric car maker has captured a sweet spot in the Chinese market  In fact  China is the biggest international market for Tesla  Inc    NASDAQ TSLA    In the second quarter of 2019  Tesla recorded  1 5 billion in sales from China  With strong sales of its Model 3  Model X and Model S in the third quarter  the Chinese government has granted a 10  purchase tax reduction to the company  exclusively As a result of the trade war  China has imposed 25  tariffs on U S  auto imports from Dec 15 which would increase the cost for Tesla  But with the 10  discount  Tesla can avoid concerns of a price rise  However  two things will constantly bother Tesla in this respect The electric car maker will have to be diligent enough to stoke up consumer demand to beat competitors  But most importantly  it must prepare itself for worse  If 25  tariffs are imposed with the existing duties on auto imports  imported autos in China will cost 50  more after Dec 15  Now  the fate of Tesla depends on the U S  China high level talks  If the trade war escalates  the company will be exposed to tariffs and the Chinese government can easily retract the purchase tax reduction In the present scenario  Tesla is already highly priced in China and any tariff induced rise could hurt its sales  However  Tesla is working hard on running its Shanghai based manufacturing plant as soon as possible Tesla  Musk and ControversiesComing to controversies  both Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk are in the spotlight  Last year  the owner of Tesla and SpaceX landed in controversies with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  In August 2018  Musk s tweet  am considering taking Tesla private at  420  Funding secured  dragged Tesla to court  Later  per a court judgment  Musk agreed to submit public statements about Tesla s finances vetted by its legal counsel  The deal with the SEC also included a damaging cost and Musk had to step down from the position of Tesla s chairman Further  in September last year  Tesla had claimed its cars to be the  safest  and said that its Model S has a 5 4 star rating  As per NHTSA  the car did get five star rating in all categories but cannot be claimed as the safest car and Tesla has been misleading its customer Another comment made by Musk in 2018 recently haunted him  Musk  in a tweet  had called Vernon Unsworth  a diver who rescued young soccer players stuck in Thailand s underwater cave a  pedo guy  and referred to him as a  child rapist   There was a rift between them since Unsworth criticized Musk s rescue plan with a submarine  In September 2018  Unsworth sued for defamation and the tussle is going on These distorted information and tweets by Tesla s CEO had led to huge volatility in the stock price  Neither the tweet on privatizing the company nor safety related comments could be ignored Tesla has been growing for a long time in spite of critics calling it as a money losing venture  Though it has provided good returns to bears and short sellers  Tesla has not posted profits in the last few years  In fact  the company s shares have declined 26 5  on a year to date basis in contrast the S P 500 s rise of 17 2  Tesla s controversies are shifting attention away from its fundamentals  The company has gained a lot of attention in the overseas market and dominates the electric vehicle market  In fact  other established automakers like Ford Motor Company   NYSE F    General Motors Company   NYSE GM    NIO Inc    NYSE NIO   and Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  AG   OTC VWAGY   are closing following it and catching up pace in electrifying their vehicles Volvo s Polestar 2 model is lately giving tough competition to Tesla s Model 3 by following some of Tesla s strategies  However  Tesla s software and battery capabilities give it an edge over its competitors  Unfortunately  Tesla s frequent controversies are distracting and disrupting its image Tesla

12,221527,NIO,China s Auto Sales Still In Free Fall  Any Recovery In Sight ,opinion,The auto sales slump in China  which is the world s largest car market  refuses to die down  In more than two decades  vehicle sales slid for the first time in China in 2018 and the country s car sales are likely to fall again this year amid macro economic headwinds  Markedly  in September  car sales in China sank for the 15th time in the past 16 months Let s delve deeper China s Auto Market Crashing  Domestic Weakness   Trade War StingAccording to data provided by China Association of Automobile Manufacturers   CAAM    auto sales fell 5 2  year over year to 2 27 million in September  This followed year over year decline of 6 9  and 4 3  in August and July  respectively  Per CAAM  sales of sedans  minivans  sports utility vehicles and SUVs in the global industry s largest market fell to 1 9 million  Waning consumer demand in the wake of tariff woes and economic slowdown is dragging down the country s vehicle sales Let s take a closer look at the latest inflation data and other economic indicators for China  The country s economic malaise is reflected in September inflation data  which released yesterday  Notably  the country s consumer inflation climbed to its highest levels in nearly six years amid rising pork prices  China s factory deflation also deepened in the month  with producer price index declining 1 2  year over year  marking the third month of contraction in a row  Contracting imports  exports and industry profits are other weak spots  Meanwhile  the country s economic slowdown has been intensified with its ongoing trade war with the United States  While a partial trade deal on Oct 11 offered a ray of hope  the trade tensions are still very much prevailing and not expected to wane anytime soon   With the economic slowdown and U S Sino trade tiff  China s auto market has been faltering like never before  Sales of new energy vehicles   NEV   including all electric and plug in hybrids declined around 34   dropping for the third consecutive month  due to a fall in government subsidies for purchases of such cars  Notably  NEV sales increased for 18 consecutive months till mid 2019  when it fell 4 7  and 15 7  in July and August  respectively  This is especially a matter of concern for China  which is targeting 60  of all automobiles sold in the country to run on electric motors by 2035  The ballooning EV market could burst  which is a concern for electric car makers like Tesla   NASDAQ TSLA   and Nio Inc    NYSE NIO   Affected by the sluggish Chinese economy  automakers are reeling from declining demand of cars in China  Slowing economy and trade war tensions have impacted consumer sentiment  which is crucial for the sale of big ticket discretionary items like automobiles China Woes Put Automakers in a Tight Spot  GM   F in FocusUncertainty with regard to the economic situation in China prompted people to tighten purse strings  in turn hitting U S  auto bigwigs like General Motors   NYSE GM   and Ford   NYSE F    Both General Motors and Ford carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  U S  top automaker General Motors  sales in China tumbled 17 5  year over year in the July September period  In addition to weak demand and trade tiff  increasing competition also impacted the company s sales in China  In fact  year to date  General Motors  sales in China have fallen 15 8   with the company reporting negative sales growth for five consecutive quarters  In a bid to restore sales  the company has targeted to launch 20 new and refreshed models in China this year  General Motors  rival  Ford s sales in China also took a hit  declining 30 3  year over year in the third quarter of 2019  Notably  Ford s sales in the country have been on a decline since 2007  A weak auto market and trade war politics continued to worsen Ford s ongoing slump in China  To revive its position in the country  the firm plans to launch more than 30 new models through 2021 More Bumps Ahead While some industry watchdogs are of the opinion that the slump in China s auto market is likely to bottom out soon  there are no signs of a turnaround yet  With every new data coming out of the country pointing to a slowdown in the economy  there is not much optimism  In fact  per Reuters  China s auto sales could witness negative to low growth over the next three years amid low consumer confidence and trade tiff with the United States  The 19 month old trade tussle between the United States and China is yet to reach a conclusion  In addition to a weak economic outlook  tighter terms for vehicle financing and increasing popularity of ride sharing platforms are also likely to weigh on car sales  With the auto sector s output being a key component in China s GDP  the government is likely to provide support in the event of a prolonged downcycle  In fact  the slowdown did prompt the Chinese authorities to take measures for boosting auto sales in order to kickstart the sputtering economy  For instance  China s State Council asked the local governments to gradually relax restrictions on auto sales  support the purchase of NEVs and expand the second hand car market in the country to prop up the auto market  The efforts have not yielded the required results yet and carmakers are waiting with bated breath to witness a rebound in China s auto market While China still needs to rev up stimulus measures for boosting sales  improvement in the economy and consumer spending  along with the U S  Sino trade truce will be crucial for the auto sector to recover from the slump  Automakers will have to be prepared for a prolonged period of weakness and resort to cost containment and other strategies to overcome the resultant challenges Free  Zacks  Single Best Stock Set to Double Today you are invited to download our just released Special Report that reveals 5 stocks with the most potential to gain  100  or more

14,221529,NIO,Can NIO Pose A Serious Challenge To Tesla s China Presence ,opinion,It seems that NIO Inc    NYSE NIO     touted as China s Tesla   NASDAQ TSLA   equivalent   has failed to live up to expectations  Electric vehicle  EV  startup Nio was talked up as a potential Tesla killer when it powered past its Chinese peers to make an IPO on NYSE last year  While NIO carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Tesla is a Zacks  2  Buy  Ranked firm  You can see NIO s unique selling proposition to provide EVs at competitive pricing has not been able to sustain the company as it is bearing the brunt of cost inefficiency  Since its IPO  the firm has tumbled roughly 64  as it is grappling with numerous challenges  While Elon Musk is accelerating Tesla s China strategy with Shanghai Gigafactory  NIO recently appointed Wei Feng as new CFO amid financial struggles  It remains to be seen if NIO can weather financial crisis and make a comeback  However  we believe that it will be a tough task for Nio to rebound and challenge Tesla s presence in China  at least in the near future  Let s delve deeper Nio in DoldrumsPer Bloomberg  NIO has piled up more than  5 billion losses in just four years In comparison  Tesla took almost 15 years to accumulate such losses  NIO has been navigating choppy waters since its listing and desperately needs a recharge to survive  as the competition in the EV market heats up in China As we know  NIO does not really manufacture its own cars  It contracts state owned JAC Motors to make vehicles  In turn  JAC charges fee for every car  Due to its partnership with JAC  NIO generates lower margins than its peers that manufacture their own cars  While the company initially planned to construct its own manufacturing facility in Shanghai  it finally dropped the plan due to financing issues  As the company relies on JAC  there is not much scope to streamline manufacturing costs  On top of that  NIO does not have a dealership network and instead sells its vehicles through apps and a network of swanky NIO Houses  located in some of the most expensive areas of China s largest cities Moreover  huge vehicle recalls are affecting the reliability and reputation of NIO  in addition to taking a toll on expenses and margins  In June  the company recalled around 5 000 ES8 electric SUVs after battery fires in China  Amid the recalls  the vehicle margin   a key metric to gauge how much a firm earns on each car it sells   plummeted to  24  in second quarter 2019  Even excluding costs related to recalls  its vehicle margin was negative 4   Despite falling deliveries and increasing loses in the second quarter of 2019  NIO has not outlined any long term profitability path yet With the company bearing the brunt of high SG A and R D costs  gross margins are taking a hit  Hence  the discount at which NIO is selling cars is not a result of operational efficiencies  Instead  the firm is losing money on every sold vehicle  NIO s sales to fixed asset ratio is one of the worst in the industry  This is particularly bad for a company that does not own assembly plants  The firm s weak cash flow situation also alleviates problems  It raised  650 million through convertible bonds just a few months after its public listing  Recently  it raised another  200 million from Tencent Holdings through convertible notes Amid high overhead costs  the company has started slashing headcounts  However  even if NIO manages to trim costs and rev up deliveries  its path to profitability seems uncertain  given macro economic headwinds in China and the reputational hit amid battery recalls Tesla Revs Up Expansion in ChinaIn contrast to NIO that has been struggling amid headwinds  Tesla is making an aggressive push to China s EV market  Tesla s Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai will give the company access to the largest EV market on the planet  It will help Tesla to bypass tariffs and cut costs substantially  Gigafactory 3 is ahead of schedule  with cars appearing to be already out for delivery  In phase 1  the firm intends to produce 250 000 annually in Gigafactory 3 and eventually reach a capacity of 500 000 units  Tesla also intends to carry out after sales network expansion in China by opening new repair and maintenance shops  along with charging stations in the country With the Gigafactory 3 being a significant catalyst for Tesla  it will become even more difficult for NIO to maintain strong margins  given its production rate and vehicle lineup Final ThoughtsChina is battling an auto slowdown amid slowing economic growth  trade tensions with the United States and roll back of subsidies on new energy vehicles  In more than two decades  vehicle sales had slid for the first time in China in 2018 and the country s car sales are likely to fall again this year amid macro economic headwinds  China s auto sales fell for the 16th consecutive month in October  with sales of new energy vehicles remaining a major concern  as the rate of decline for EVs has been increasing With the phasing out of subsidies  foreign carmakers are trying to make inroads into China s EV market  While Ford   NYSE F   is revamping its product line

21,221536,NIO,What Commodities And Transportation Are Telling Us  Part II,opinion,"In part I of this report we talked about what commodities and transports where doing in relation to each other  Here in Part II  we show you in detail what we expect to take place 
This chart highlights our Custom Smart Cash Index  in blue  as well as the CBOE Commodity Index pricing levels  red   This data goes all the way back to 2012 and highlights a number of key pricing rotations  First  we can see that commodities have been decreasing in total value from 2012 through mid 2017  We can also identify a key support level that was established in the commodities index near the beginning of 2016   coming just a month or so before the bottom in the Smart Cash Index 
We believe this key bottom in both the commodities and Smart Cash indices reflect a dramatic pricing shift that took place at that point in time  Although commodities have yet to rally beyond their upper high ranges  we can see the Smart Cash Index rallied to new all time highs  The rally that started near the end of 2016 in the Smart Cash Index was likely the result of a capital shift  which we have discussed extensively in the past  With commodity prices staying historically low and an increase in economic optimism  capital shifted away from commodity based sectors and into technology and biotech  Now it appears this rally has run its course and a new capital shift is taking place 

Until commodities begin to break out of the downward price channels highlighted on this chart  global capital will be searching for two primary objectives  safety and hedged returns  By this  we mean to say that global capital and investment will seek out strong blue chip and mid cap performers that can produce safety in growth  dividends and hedge against currency swings or further eroding commodity price levels  Think of this as a move to key elements supporting the global economies 
Watch heavy equipment  support services and retailers  tool suppliers and mid level equipment suppliers  transportation services for these items and the repair parts and services to keep these tools running efficiently  Human services  labor  labor services  medical services and entertainment services are likely to do well over the next 12 24 months  In an economy where commodity prices are relatively low and transportation and capital are flowing quite well  one can easily see that capital will seek out and identify the strongest opportunity for safety and growth as sectors continue to shift  After a massive rally in technology and bio tech  we believe a continued shift toward blue  and mid caps is taking place right now  Technology and bio tech will likely find some support in the near future and become opportunistic investments  But right now  we believe global investors are focusing on different targets to hedge the risks that are associated with certain technology stocks 
In closing  our research highlights that commodities are not increasing as one would expect in an expanding global market economy  We believe this is one core factor that will continue to drive a capital shift toward opportunity and performance in the blue  and mid caps  Investors will re enter the technology and bio tech sectors when pricing levels become more opportunistic   at some point in the future  This means there is a strong likelihood that US and global blue chips  banks  industrial supply  basic materials and human services  entertainment  basic human essentials  regional human services and utilities  will continue to perform well 
The US and the global economy is growing  just not as one would expect in a  total growth  environment  We believe the global economy has shifted to support fundamental growth elements that are related more closely to the types of industry and market sectors that support the fundamental growth components  We ve discussed our theory that global economies operate in a  growth or protection mode  many times before  We believe the current global economic stance is more in tune with moderate growth while still being overly protective  Watch commodities and the transportation index for signs that the global economy has entered a larger growth phase and for more opportunity of a broader capital shift 
This concludes our two part series on how we identify market opportunities  Analysis like this has allowed us to generate substantial profits in the past 30 days with UGAZ 30   NIO 21 6   ROKU 18  and GDXJ 10 5  ",2019-03-06,Chris Vermeulen,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-commodities-and-transportation-are-telling-us-part-ii-200395224,200395224

Stocks were weak once again  We can see in the chart that the S P 500 is testing its lows from the other day  and for now those lows are holding  At this point  I can t say I m overly concerned  A pullback to 2 750 wouldn t concern me either 

Russell  RUT 
The Russell  now that is a different story  We can see the index has broken its uptrend and a drop below 1 530 clearly triggers a steeper decline to 1 492  Diverging indexes are never a good sign  We really need to see the Russell stabilize here  I would get more nervous over the short term should the Russell crack below 1 530  It would likely signal a steeper pullback for the S P 500 too  We will need to monitor 

Biotech  XBI 
The SPDR S P Biotech  NYSE XBI  continues to look really weak  and a drop to  85 25 seems likely at this point 

Nio Inc  NIO 
NIO Inc  NYSE NIO  shares tanked over 20   I went through the story this morning  The stock fell right through support at  8 35 and now appears to be on its way to that  7 72 region I mentioned earlier 

General Electric  GE 
General Electric Company  NYSE GE  also continues to fall  and I noted this morning the stock was facing a decline below  9  This afternoon it seems like those odds just improved for a drop to  8 90 

AT T  T 
AT T Inc  NYSE T  continues to look really weak  The stock continues to fall after failing at resistance at  31 20 and suggests a decline to  28 92  In fact  according to data from SmartStops  the equity just entered an elevated risk state indicating there may be further declines ahead 

Blackberry  BB 
I have really screwed up this BlackBerry Ltd  NYSE BB   after weeks of getting it right  I guess I ran out luck  I don t know  I have to think about this one  The RSI really bothers me though 

Micron  MU 
Micron Technology Inc  NASDAQ MU  is another one that has turned against me  This one appears to be entering a region where it should find support around  36 and bounce 

Advanced Micro Devices Inc  AMD 
Advanced Micro Devices Inc  NASDAQ AMD  also has turned sour  A drop below  22 80 means  21 is coming 

Amazon  AMZN 
Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  is failing at this downtrend  I really thought this time it would break out  We will need to watch this one closely now 

Netflix  NFLX

NIO Inc  NYSE NIO  shares are falling 15  in the pre market after the company reported results that fell short of expectations  No headlines of doom or breaking news alert push messages on this one though  The stock is sinking  and there appears to be a triple top formed with a drop below  8 35 pushing the stock lower to  7 72

Tesla  TSLA 
Tesla Inc  NASDAQ TSLA   however  is trading slightly higher this morning  The stock has been whacked in recent days  I think the decline in the shares seems a bit excessive 
But I did a find a piece of evidence to suggest that Tesla is indeed rushing the Model Y by moving the event to March 14  get this  BY ONE FULL DAY  Yes  1 Day  Here is a Tweet from the Man himself on May 23  2018 at 11 52PM 


Of course  this is part of a series of Tweets where he admits he made it up at first  Regardless  it would suggest to me that the intention has always been there for unveiling around this time  Plus March was when they revealed the Model 3 for the first time  I would hardly say this news is rushed 
Anyway  it looks like the Bloomberg Model 3 tracker is suggesting that Tesla has produced about 60 000 units so far this quarter  At the current pace of 5 700 per week  it may result in the company producing pretty close to 85 000 units for the quarter  just in Model 3 s  In the fourth quarter  they made a total of nearly 62 000  That is almost a 40  increase in production  but demand for the car is soft  Right 
Anyway  the stock has fallen to its lowest levels since October  but the good thing is that the RSI somehow is still trending higher 

Qualcomm  QCOM 
Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  continues to trend higher  I wrote the other day how I was still seeing bullish options betting in the stock  An increase to  56 continues to look likely over the short term 

General Electric  GE 
The last one for today is General Electric Company  NYSE GE   The stock continues to be a disaster  Every time  you think the last piece of bad news is priced in  more bad news comes  Yesterday out of nowhere comes the cashflow bomb  A decline below  9 00 seems entirely possible given its latest decline and break below the uptrend

24,221539,NIO,A Central Bank War Just Started And Its Good For Stocks,opinion,"ECB Effects
The move in the euro was huge  falling over 200 pips  huge  But the most important piece here is that the euro broke essential support at 1 13  I wrote up my thoughts on why the euro could even fall to parity  and why the Fed may need to cut rates later this year 

Draghi was very dovish today with his outlook  so much so that German Bunds fell to around 6 bps from 13 bps  Our 10 year fell to 2 63   A break below 2 62  sends the 10 year back to its December lows 

Over time investors should come to realize that rates will remain low and that the Fed will need to stay on hold to avoid having the dollar strengthen too much  Should the dollar rise  it will kill off whatever inflationary forces there are while hurting our multinational companies  The result may be a Fed that needs to cut rates by late 2019 to keep the dollar in line versus the euro and avoid this scenario 
But this should be good for stocks as investors move out on the risk curve  and low interest rate foster multiple expansion for stocks 
S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY  
Stocks did end up falling some  with the S P 500 dropping by roughly 80 basis point to 2 748  Certainly not the end of days  but a decline worth noting  The S P 500 did manage to close at a pretty substantial level of support around 2 750  Remember this was one of the reasons I had some hesitation a couple of weeks backs about the market  and a level I tried to keep in the back of everyone s mind  Now that gap is filled  what next 
From my point of view  it is now crucial for the S P 500 to hold support around this 2 735 level  A drop below that support zone gets things moving to the downside with the potential for a drop below 2 700 

Russell 2000  IWM 
The Russell s decline was the most noticeable because it did fall below that level of support I had noted last night at 1 535  The Russell s drop has me much more concerned than the S P 500 at this point  The chart now suggestions that the index could drop by another 2  to around 1 492  There is a minor support level about at 1 520  but I have no confidence in that level acting as anything substantial 
I know 2  doesn t sound like much  but consider that the Russell was at 1 600 on February 23  When you think about that way  we are talking about a nearly 7  drop from that peak 
You can even make a case for the Russell to drop back to around 1 450 a full 9  off those February highs  But it would create a very bullish pattern known a reverse head and shoulders  That could eventually lead to higher prices down the road 
Again  my outlook for the full year continues to suggest stock will continue to head higher  That is not to say there will not be pullbacks along the way 

Nio  NYSE NIO 
Nio continues to deflate  and it looks like it may be possible now for a drop to  6 50 

Splunk  NASDAQ SPLK 
Splunk is nearing a potentially big breakdown should it fall below  123  potentially to  108 

Facebook  NASDAQ FB 
Facebook was lower today  and the stock is looking more and more as if filling the gap at  148 is around the corner 

Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX 
Netflix was also down today  falling back to  352  The stock has looked very weak  and a drop to  337 seems possible still 

Apple  NASDAQ AAPL 
Apple got as high as  178  pretty close but no cigar to the  182 I was looking for  Now the stock is sitting on an uptrend and a break of that uptrend pushes the shares back to  165 

JD  JD 
JD is still looking as if it could drop to around  26 over the coming days 

NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA 
Finally  Nvidia did fall below  150 today  and I m still looking for that  139 to  140 region 

See you on Jobs Friday

25,221540,NIO,Does Nio Have What It Takes To Get Out Of Penny Stock Territory ,opinion,"Nio Inc   NYSE NIO  hasn t been the Cinderella story that many had originally hoped for since its IPO  There s no denying that its debut on the US markets was exciting especially when it hit highs of nearly  14 a share  But that s where the excitement tends to tailor off a bit  Over the last few months and recently  the last few weeks  shares of the  Chinese Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA   have dropped to all time lows  In fact  last week Nio shares fell into penny stock territory 
Does this electric vehicle company really have what it takes to get out of the range of becoming a penny stock  If you were to ask someone   What is a penny stock   the basic definition is a stock that trades under  5 per share  Given that Nio had been briefly trading below  5 last week  it technically flirted with the penny stock price level  But why 
Nio Running On Fumes At The End Of Q1
In early March  investors saw Nio shares plummet from  10 16 on March 5 to an opening price of  8 26 the following day  What contributed most to this was the company s latest earnings report  More specifically it was the corporate guidance offered for the future of Nio 
Though people like Jim Cramer say they  wouldn t sell  Nio  Wall Street didn t necessarily feel the same way  Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE NYSE BAC  downgraded the stock from Neutral to Underperform 
The sequential slowdown in vehicle deliveries in January and February was mainly caused by accelerated deliveries made at the end of last year in anticipation of EV subsidy reductions in China in 2019  the seasonal slowdowns surrounding the January 1st and Chinese New Year holidays  as well as the current slowdown of macro economic conditions in China  particularly in the automotive sector   said Nio in a company statement 
A Light At The End Of The Test Tunnel For Nio
Though Q4 figures showed positive progress  there will be hurdles for Nio to get over  Let s look at some of the highlights that could positively impact Nio considering the drab outlook guided by the company 
For starters  the company s update on first quarter deliveries came in above its original expectations  The company is expected between 3 500 and 3 800 ES8s delivered  compared to 7 980 in Q4   As of March 31  2019  cumulative ES8 deliveries reached over 15 000 vehicles with 3 989 being delivered in the first quarter  This figure was higher by 339 vehicles compared to its guidance range midpoint of 3 650 
Additionally  the recent dip in price could have added more exposure to investors who simply do not have attention on stocks outside of the  penny stock  range  One article even states   So  on the bright side  maybe this drop opened up new attention from investors who would have not seen the company  otherwise  
Several milestones for the company continue to breed investor confidence  Financial results showed things like delivery to nearly 8 000 customers  which is about 1 10th of Tesla s Q4 deliveries for its last period  This figure surpasses company expectations and compared to its initial guidance from the end of 2018  the trend has continued in exceeding anticipated growth figures 
Nio also hinted at an  affordable  auto  the ES6  This model is set for production later this year with a sticker of roughly  52 000 
A Clear Road For An EV Gold Rush
Due  in part to the recent changes in China s standards for new energy vehicles  which will qualify for subsidies  the EV market is getting hot for big money raises  Furthermore  a particular deal struck at the time of the Nio IPO could bring an advantage  It happened to be that the Chinese electric vehicle maker blocked the eight top investment banks that did its IPO from working for rivals  They did this by placing in a year long non compete clause according to Reuters 
The top eight banks worldwide for equity sales in 2018  were Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Citigroup  NYSE NYSE C   Credit Suisse  SIX SIX CSGN   Deutsche Bank  DE DE DBKGn   Goldman Sachs  NYSE NYSE GS   JPMorgan  NYSE NYSE JPM   Morgan Stanley  NYSE NYSE MS   and UBS  NYSE UBS  according to Refinitiv data  They all were also the banks that Nio had hired 
Though the Reuters source didn t consent to be named  this could give Nio a strong lead  NIO s rivals will essentially be blocked from raising public or private funds from these banks for 12 months following the IPO 
A Look At The Landscape
As the major global banks could be locked up for now  the landscape for EV in China continues to grow  Leap Motor  a smaller EV producer was seeking a private raise of about  372 million  Deutsche Bank and Chinese brokerage Huatai United Securities are acting as the advisors on the deal 
In January  Byton sought to raise at least  500 million to finance its growth according to Reuters  The company is only 3 years old but already has more than 50 000 customers and a valuation of more than  4 billion according to its CEO and Co Founder  Daniel Kirchert 
Finally  WM Motor recently announced that it had closed its Series C funding round of  446 16 million  3 billion Yuan   The raise was led by Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU   In total  the company has been able to raise around  3 4 billion  23 billion Yuan  ",2019-04-02,Joe Sirianni,https://www.investing.com/analysis/does-nio-have-what-it-takes-to-get-out-of-penny-stock-territory-200403198,200403198
26,221541,NIO,China Stimulus  Buy Nio,opinion,"Most of the investing public is running scared from shares of China electric car maker Nio  NYSE NIO   However  after falling from a 52 week high of  13 80 to its current  2 58  investors may want to take a second speculative look  China stimulus is getting into the system and more is coming  In fact  China will be forced to compete with lower interest rates and additional stimulus from the European Central Bank  Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan  The government looks at electric cars as essential for the future power of China by eliminating smog in the major cities  Car makes like NIO will see additional help and support from the Chinese government  While deliveries have fallen lately  that is likely within a month or two of changing as the stimulus kicks in 
The trade deal  while it may go on for a little longer  will end  The end date will likely be prior to the 2020 elections  At 52 week lows  any hint of a cease fire or agreement between the United States and China will send shorts running  President Trump needs a win going into the election and a deal with China that stimulates the economy might be the one thing that could help him win  and he knows it  
On a technical basis  NIO has already made a pivot low on June 14 at  2 35  After that low  the stock ran over  3 00 and is currently in a classic bull retrace  In addition  technical metrics like the RSI and MACD are showing positive divergences  signaling further upside is likely  The stock is still oversold on a monthly and weekly basis signaling there is still upside to go  I have a technical target in the next couple months of  4 35  That is a potential upside move of 70   Hedge funds continue to hold large positions with a long term view  In the last two weeks  sellers have started to fade with volume becoming lighter while large block buyers have increased 
Please note  this is a speculative call on a small mid cap stock  Any position should be small and part of a diversified portfolio ",2019-06-27,Gareth Soloway,https://www.investing.com/analysis/china-stimulus-buy-nio-200435369,200435369
27,221542,NIO,2 Chinese Stocks Seeing Unusually Heavy Options Trading,opinion,"Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have kept U S  listed Chinese stocks on the collective radar  Two names in particular that options traders have been eyeing are Hangzhou based e commerce concern Alibaba  NYSE BABA  and Shanghai based electric car maker Nio  NYSE NIO 
In fact  both BABA and NIO popped up on a list of stocks that have seen the heaviest weekly options activity in the past 10 days  courtesy of Schaeffer s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White  with names highlighted in yellow new to the list  The bulk of activity for both BABA and NIO has occurred on the call side 

Alibaba Bulls See More Upside
Alibaba saw 200 847 calls change hands over the past two weeks  compared to 116 524 puts  A healthy portion of this was likely a result of speculators purchasing new positions  per BABA s 10 day call put volume ratio of 2 36 at the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Cboe Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX   which ranks in the 74th annual percentile  meaning calls have been bought to open over puts at an accelerated clip 
Drilling down  the September 175 call saw the biggest increase in open interest over this two week time frame  and was likely used alongside the September 175 put to initiate a straddle in the now back month series  As far as weekly options  nearly 6 000 weekly 8 30 180 strike calls were initiated in the last 10 sessions  some of which were bought  according to data from the major options exchanges 
Today  amid lighter than usual volume  speculators appear to be buying to open BABA s weekly 7 26 175 strike call for a volume weighted average price of  1 11  By doing so  call buyers expect the stock to jump above breakeven at  176 11  strike plus premium paid  by expiration at the close this Friday  July 26  At last check  Alibaba stock is down 0 6  at  171 98  testing recent support at its 80 day moving average and a trendline connecting higher lows since late May 

Nio Call Traders See Bigger Short Term Gains
In the last 10 sessions  199 729 Nio call options traded  compared to 69 062 puts  Data from the ISE  CBOE  and PHLX confirms significant buy to open activity in the past two weeks  per the stock s top heavy 10 day call put volume ratio of 4 05 
While the August 3 call saw the biggest increase among non expired options over this time frame  the weekly 7 26 3 50 strike call was also popular  Data from the major options exchanges confirms significant buy to open activity at each strike  meaning speculators are targeting short term gains for the Chinese stock 
Most recently  though  NIO shares are trading down 0 5  at  3 35  The equity rebounded from its June 17 record low of  2 35  but ran out of steam at the  4 mark    near its 80 day moving average and its late May pre bear gap levels  Year to date  Nio stock is down 47 4  ",2019-07-23,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-chinese-stocks-seeing-unusually-heavy-options-trading-200442862,200442862

30,221545,NIO,Wall Street slips from records as investors lock in year end gains,news,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK  Reuters    Wall Street s major stock indexes slipped from record highs on Monday as investors booked profits from gains made this month after the United States and China reached a trade deal 
The S P 500  the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq posted their biggest one day percentage declines in about four weeks 
Monday brought minor updates on the U S  China trade agreement  White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the pact was likely to be signed in the next week but that confirmation would come from President Donald Trump or U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer 
A South China Morning Post report said Chinese Vice Premier Liu He would travel to Washington later this week to sign the deal 
The news provided little impetus for U S  stocks to extend their steep climb  analysts said  Going into Monday  the benchmark S P 500 had notched record high closes in nine of the past 11 sessions 
 Many traders and portfolio managers have reached their targets and don t want to jeopardize their performance   said Quincy Krosby  chief market strategist at Prudential Financial  NYSE PRU  in Newark  New Jersey   So it s not unusual to see some profit taking as we get to the close of the year  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  fell 183 12 points  or 0 64   to 28 462 14  the S P 500  SPX  lost 18 73 points  or 0 58   to 3 221 29 and the Nasdaq Composite  IXIC  dropped 60 62 points  or 0 67   to 8 945 99 
Communications services stocks  SPLRCL  fell 1   the biggest percentage decline among the S P 500 s sectors  Technology stocks  SPLRCT  dropped 0 6  and weighed most heavily on the benchmark index  Technology  up 47 5  year to date  and communication services  up 30 6   have led in percentage gains on the S P 500 this year 
It is  not uncommon for the leading sectors to pull back first when people start to sell because if it is an outperformer  then it warrants a lot more downside risk   said Randy Frederick  vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  in Austin  Texas 
On Tuesday  stocks will trade on Wall Street for a full session prior to Wednesday s New Year s Day break  In a bright spot among U S  stocks  Nio Inc  N NIO  shares surged 53 7  after the Chinese electric vehicle maker and Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  rival beat quarterly revenue estimates on higher demand 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1 43 to 1 ratio  on Nasdaq  a 1 52 to 1 ratio favored decliners 
The S P 500 posted 17 new 52 week highs and no new lows  the Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 29 new lows

Shares of NIO  NYSE NIO   a Chinese designer and manufacturer of premium electric vehicles  EVs   were soaring more than 60  early Monday afternoon after the struggling automaker released better than expected financial results for the third quarter 
So what
Deliveries jumped 35  sequentially  reaching 4 799 during the third quarter  That helped drive vehicle sales to  242 5 million during the quarter  a 22 5  increase from the second quarter and a 21 5  improvement from the prior year s third quarter  Total revenue increased 25  to  257 million versus the prior year  easily topping analysts  estimates of  234 million 
Vehicle margin checked in at a negative 6 8  during the third quarter  which was a large sequential improvement from the negative 24 1  in the second quarter  but slightly worse than the prior year s negative 4 3   NIO s net loss was  352 8 million during the third quarter  a 23 3  decrease from the second quarter and a 10 3  decrease from the prior year s result 
 The electric vehicle sector experienced substantial softness in the second half of 2019 after the reduction of EV subsidies in China   CEO William Bin Li said in a press release   Despite the challenges  NIO s sales improved solidly since September

Even with today s surge  it s been a bumpy ride for investors over the past year  Management reiterated confidence that the company s financial health would improve as cost cutting efforts begin to gain traction  During its third annual NIO Day on Dec  28  it unveiled its new EC6 model  which is expected to compete with Tesla s Model Y  giving hope that better days are ahead for sales and financial results 
While NIO s stock is up 133  over the past three months  it remains one of the riskier auto stocks in the market  Furthermore  it seems fairly clear the company needs capital  and investors should keep an eye out for possible announcements of a financing deal  If the company can secure reasonable capital  successfully accelerate sales of its EVs  and cut costs  it ll go a long way to persuading investors that 2019 was only a speed bump on its way to a bright future ",2019-12-30,The Motley Fool,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/30/why-shares-of-nio-raced-over-70-higher-monday-afte.aspx?source=iedfolrf0000001,2050025
32,221547,NIO,6 Stocks To Watch  Nivida Could Be Falling,opinion,"6 Stocks To Watch  March 6 Trading Session
Stocks
Stocks went pretty much nowhere on March 5  with the S P 500 finishing the day down about 10 bps  I was modestly surprised that stocks didn t get a boost from the strong services PMI data which came in at 59 7 versus estimates of 57 2  It was one of the highest reading in some time 

Let us not forget that the services industry in the US far outweighs the manufacturing sector 

While it is nice to obsess about weak manufacturing PMI s because it sounds so dire and creates headlines of doom  let s just stop and call it a day 
Biotech  XBI 
BiotechI stocks plunged on the news that FDA Commish Dr  Scott Gottlieb is resigning  The only reason for the decline is that the market fears the unknown  and not knowing the next commissioner is the unknown  Sell first  ask questions later 
You can see from the chart below that the day was going rather well for Biotech  that is  before the news 

Netflix  NFLX 
I drew in a new trend line for Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   and this time it is a downtrend  The stock did rise today  but notice where the stock stopped rising  right at resistance at  355 

Alphabet  GOOGL 
Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  popped above  1 170 briefly  and that could step up a rise to  1225 

Roku Inc  ROKU 
Roku Inc  NASDAQ ROKU  was up today  I m assuming on the news that you can now use Alexa and Roku together  I download the skill to my Alexa  it s ok  certainly not worth a 3  rise in the stock  
IQiyi  IQ 
iQIYI Inc  NASDAQ IQ  went up today  it doesn t seem to care what I think  Not many stocks do  Someone asked me if it is possible for IQiyi to consolidate sideways back to the trend line  I would agree with that  it is entirely possible  I will also admit at this point a move lower to  24 is likely not on the table anymore  I still think it is overbought based on that RSI 

Nivida  NVDA 
I m beginning to regret changing my view on NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA  a few weeks back to increasing to  178  Because now  I have to admit that it was the wrong call  and now I have to flip back to say I think it is going to fall  It just makes me feel dumb  But I m going to flip  sorry  folks  It doesn t happen that often  but Nvidia just doesn t look right  So a drop below  150 sends it back towards  139  and I do see this one falling 

Nio  NIO 
I have a rhetorical question  why is that everybody screams and cries about Tesla s valuation  but yet the start up NIO Inc  NYSE NIO  is praised as the Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  killer  The company has a market cap that is a third of Ford and Fiat  That is right Nio has a  10 billion market cap 

The company is even more expensive than Tesla  I don t see as much as of controversy around Nio and its valuation  Hardly even the same amount of short interest in the stock either

34,221549,NIO,3 Reasons NIO   China s Tesla   Should Be On Your Radar,opinion,"In case you ve never heard of it  NIO Inc   NYSE NIO  is a Shanghai based automobile manufacturer specializing in designing and developing electric autonomous vehicles  The company  which has been dubbed the  Tesla of China   was founded four years ago and listed on the New York Stock Exchange this past September  raising  1 8 billion 
It currently offers two main models  the ES6  which is a five passenger SUV with a 358 000 yuan  or  52 000 price tag  and the ES8  which is an upscale  seven passenger  three row SUV positioned as a domestic Chinese alternative to Tesla s  NASDAQ TSLA  Model X  It s priced at 448 000 yuan  or around  65 000 versus the Model X s sticker price of  113 000 
NIO s third model  the EP9  is an electric powered  two seater sports car  which the company claims is one of the world s fastest electric cars  Its 1 360 horsepower engine propels it to 160 mph in 7 1 seconds  Only six have been sold so far for a hefty  1 2 million apiece 
Besides the incredible upside for the entire electric vehicle industry  thus for the company as well  there are three additional reasons which we believe makes this stock something that should be on every investor s radar 
1  Accelerating Sales in China
NIO delivered a total of 11 348 vehicles in 2018  over fulfilling their respective sales targets  among which 3 318 units were handed over in December alone 

The company is already outselling Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  in China by a wide margin  as the U S  electric automaker has struggled under trade war tariffs  which have driven up the price of its Model X SUV and Model 3 Sedan 

China is the world s largest and fast growing market for new energy vehicles  NEVs   a category comprising electric battery cars and plug in electric hybrids  China s NEV sales shot up 61 7  year on year to 1 256 million units in 2018  according to sales data released by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers  CAAM  
Looking beyond China  NIO has ambitions to expand into Europe and the U S  in the next two to three years  according to Jack Cheng  one of the founders of NIO and now the CEO of XPT  NIO s powertrain division  He says it s 

 The first vehicle to market to the European standard already so we will be able to take a step into Europe  Then we can begin moving into the U S  because it is a more critical market  

2  Big Time Investor Backing
The buzz about NIO increased following reports that U K  investment management firm and Tesla investor Baillie Gifford acquired an 11 4  stake in the Chinese company on Oct  9  The firm owns 85 3 million NIO shares  the company said in a filing with the U S  s Securities and Exchange Commission 
The news made some serious waves  Baillie Gifford is Tesla s largest outside shareholder  with a 9  stake  Tesla s largest investor  founder and CEO Elon Musk  owns about 20  of shares 
Investment advisory firm Vanguard and Morgan Stanley also disclosed that they purchased 19 million and 12 million shares respectively of NIO during the most recent quarter  Other prominent investors include China s Tencent Holdings  OTC TCEHY   tech company Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU   privately held Singaporean holding company Temasek  Chinese tech company Lenovo  OTC LNVGF  and Sequoia Capital 
Additionally  notorious short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research published a lengthy thesis on NIO and made the long case for shares to rally to  12  They re currently trading at  7 44 as of yesterday s close 
 Just like Tesla was not a simple U S  electric car story  NIO is so much more than just a Chinese electric car story  NIO s visionary management is revolutionizing the high end auto industry in China   he wrote in a note on Nov  19  According to Citron  the Chinese EV automaker is  not just a car company   but  a lifestyle and a brand that is ready to disrupt  
3  Bullish Technical Picture
Since shares began trading on Sept  12  the stock hit a high of  13 80 and a low of  5 62  At yesterday s closing price  that represents a gain of around 19 4  from its IPO price of  6 00 
From a technical standpoint  the stock broke above key resistance near the  8 30 level on Feb  6  before pulling back in a constructive manner  towards its 50 day moving average at around  7  The stock needs to hold this level before successfully retesting its recent breakout price ",2019-02-13,Jesse Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-nio-chinas-tesla-should-be-on-your-radar-200387204,200387204
35,221550,NIO,Is It The Right Time To Enter NIO  The Tesla Of China ,opinion,"NIO Inc  NYSE NIO   the Chinese electric carmaker that has given a stellar year to date return of 50   Let us look at the various factors which are driving the stock higher 
Electric vehicle industry is one of the hottest investment ideas as the automobile industry transitions from the combustion engine to the hybrids  China is the leading producer of new energy vehicles  NEVs  
The stock is up in the past couple of days after the CBS 60 Minutes interview which focused on how the company is working to become more of a lifestyle brand in China  For a question of whether the company aspires to be the Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  of China  The founder and CEO William Li replied 
 It s like the clothes fashion models wear on the catwalk    It s not the same  They may be beautiful  but you can t wear them every day   The comparison continued to include supermodels   So Tesla is the supermodel and you re the girl next door   asked correspondent Holly    Williams     Yeah   Li replied  He further mentioned that the China will manufacture more than 1 million electric vehicles this year with massive support from the government 
The company is founded in 2014 by Chinese entrepreneur William LI  It is backed by the Chinese Technology Company Tencent Holdings Ltd  HK 0700   It got listed in September 2018 
The company is expected to release its fourth quarter 2018 results on March 05  2019  During the third quarter results released on November 06  2018 revenue rose 3 095  to RMB 1 469 million  US  214 million  when compared to the second quarter of 2018  Net loss was RMB 2 810 million an increase of 57  from the second quarter 
Cash and cash equivalent at the end of November 2018 was RMB 9 153 million  USD 1 3 billion   The company recently raises  650 million through the convertible bond 
The initial demand for the company s vehicles is very strong  NIO began deliveries of the ES8  a 7 seater high performance electric SUV in China from June 2018  The company delivered 3 318 ES8 vehicles in December 2018 when compared to 3 089 delivered in November and a total of 11 348 vehicles in June to December 2018 period  The company could also give a tough competition for Tesla vehicles in the China market due to lower pricing and also the company is able to ramp up the production 
After the success of ES8  the company has launched lower priced electric SUV ES6 in December 2018 for a price of around  50 000 which is around  14 000 less than the ES8  The deliveries are expected in June 2019 
Risks
China is reducing the subsidies given to electric vehicles  Even though it is the biggest market there is intense competition in the Chinese EV market  Slowing Chinese economy could also put a dent on the company s revenues  The company is young and the production has only begun last year 
Conclusion
This is a high growth stock  Investors need to understand the risk of investing in such companies  However  returns could also very high  Also  the company s efficiency in producing vehicles on time is very appreciable  It could also attract Tesla investors and other investors who are interested to invest in electric vehicles

37,221552,NIO,Stock Market News  Tesla Falls  NIO Jumps as Electric Cars Heat Up,news,"The stock market gave up ground on Monday morning  as investors couldn t continue to ride positive momentum from earlier in the holiday period into the final two days of 2019  Investors are trying to stay confident about their views for the market and the U S  economy in 2020  but many still point to the strong market performance in the past year as a reason to expect at least a pause in the upward trends of major stock indexes  As of 11 a m  EST  the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJINDICES  DJI  was down 178 points to 28 468  The S P 500  SNPINDEX  GSPC  lost 18 points to 3 222  while the Nasdaq Composite  NASDAQINDEX  IXIC  fell 70 points to 8 937 
Even though holiday trading was relatively quiet  there was considerable attention on the electric vehicle market  Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  saw its stock give up some ground  but Chinese counterpart NIO  NYSE NIO  enjoyed solid gains on good news for the industry 
Will Tesla underdeliver 
Shares of Tesla were down more than 3  Monday morning as investors reacted to mixed news  Although the electric vehicle pioneer celebrated a key milestone  some of those following the stock aren t as comfortable about its near term prospects 

On the positive side  Tesla delivered its first Model 3 cars from its Chinese Gigafactory facility in Shanghai  The plant produced 15 electric cars for Tesla employees  celebrating the end of a year long process of getting the China production site up and running  Tesla has high hopes for the facility  especially because it will allow the company to serve the growing Chinese consumer auto market without facing the same trade related tensions that come with bringing vehicles across the Pacific from U S  production plants 
However  Tesla got a dose of pessimism from stock analysts at Cowen  The analysts believe that Tesla s full year delivery numbers are likely to fall short of the 360 000 to 400 000 vehicles that the company has projected  The shortfall could come in large part because the automaker s higher end Model S and Model X vehicles haven t seen as much demand as initially expected  and Cowen thinks that the stock could get cut in half from current levels if demand from mature auto markets doesn t accelerate soon 
Tesla s stock has been extremely volatile  and opinions about the carmaker are strong on both sides  In the end  investors will have to wait to see how Tesla actually performs in the long run  especially in key markets like China 
NIO gets a charge
Shares of NIO soared more than 40  as the Chinese electric vehicle maker announced its latest financial results  Although NIO has suffered through a painful few months  today s news has apparently restored some confidence in the stock 
NIO s numbers indicated continued growth  The company delivered almost 4 800 vehicles in the third quarter of 2019  up from about 3 550 vehicles in the second quarter  About 4 200 of those deliveries were of the ES6 SUV model  while NIO delivered just over 600 of its higher end ES8 SUVs  Overall revenue was up 22  compared to three months earlier  and losses narrowed from previous levels 
What has some investors especially excited is the fact that NIO has announced a new model  The EC6 will be what the company calls a  smart premium electric coupe SUV   and CEO William Bin Li believes that the automaker s  pursuit of both high performance and stylish design in our products  should help it overcome pressures from reductions in government subsidies for electric vehicles 
NIO and Tesla will continue to fight hard for supremacy in the Chinese electric car market  but there s likely more than enough room for both to prosper  With so much potential  China could become the most important market for electric vehicles on the planet    and investors will have to place their bets on whether Tesla or NIO will end up on top ",2019-12-30,The Motley Fool,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/30/stock-market-news-tesla-falls-nio-jumps-as-electri.aspx?source=iedfolrf0000001,2049939

Founder and CEO William Bin Li said NIO delivered a total of 4 799 ES8 and ES6 vehicles in the third quarter of 2019  representing a 35 1  increase from the second quarter  The electric vehicle sector experienced substantial softness in the second half of 2019 after the reduction of EV subsidies in China  Despite the challenges  NIO s sales improved solidly since September    We expect over 8 000 vehicles to be delivered in the fourth quarter  a record of quarterly deliveries in our history  With that  the total aggregate deliveries in 2019 are estimated to reach over 20 300 At its  Nio Day  event last week  the company announced a new 100 kWh battery pack for the top of the line ES8 and a 20 kWh home fast charging unit  The 100 kWh battery pack can be swapped in for existing ES8s with the original 74 kWh pack because the two battery packs are designed to fit into the same amount of space For the fourth quarter  ending this month  Nio expects to deliver 8 000 units  a 67  sequential increase  Total revenues are projected at  393 2 million  up about 53  sequentially Analysts are forecasting a quarterly net loss per share of  0 30 and revenues of  289 19 million  For the full year  the forecast net loss totals  1 49 on sales of  1 03 billion The smaller than expected per share loss  the higher revenues and the forecast for a jump of almost a third in quarterly revenues has made investors giddy  Shares traded up around 20  in Monday s premarket  at  2 90 in a 52 week range of  1 19 to  10 64  The 12 month consensus price target is  3 03

39,221554,NIO,NIO s Sales Are Rising  but Is It Enough ,news,"Chinese electric automaker NIO  NYSE NIO  said that it delivered 2 528 vehicles in November  down from a year ago but in line with its October result  as its sales rebound held steady after a tough second quarter 
NIO is still thought to be running dangerously low on cash  But the company is proceeding as if all is well  opening new stores and hinting that a new model is coming soon 
Best month of 2019  but still down from 2018
NIO s November delivery total was down 18  from November of 2018  but it was still the company s best month for deliveries since the beginning of the year  

In a statement  CEO William Li said that the company expanded its network of stores in November by opening 37 new  NIO Spaces   These are smaller and simpler  and less expensive  versions of its Apple Store inspired  NIO Houses   Together with the existing NIO Houses  the company now has one or more outlets in 41 Chinese cities  
Li also noted that sales of NIO s larger ES8 crossover jumped over 50  from October as a new longer range version launched last month began shipping to customers  NIO had said previously that a new 84 kilowatt hour battery would become available on both the two row  5 passenger  ES6 and the three row  6 or 7 passenger  ES8 in October  

NIO had cut the price of the entry level ES6 Standard Version at the end of September  ahead of the launch of the longer range version  
Is this good news 
It s hard to know  as NIO has been extraordinarily secretive about the state of its finances since it revealed on Sept  24 that it had burned about  620 million in the second quarter  leaving it with just  503 4 million in cash as of June 30  
The company had said in early September that it expected to raise  200 million by the end of the month  but it has yet to confirm whether that deal actually happened  China s National Business Daily reported that another anticipated financing deal  with a district government in Zhejiang province  fell through  with government officials citing  heavy risks  as the reason  
That latter deal would have given NIO an infusion of at least  707 million  along with assistance in building a much needed factory  
Given all that  and given that NIO has yet to even announce a date for its third quarter earnings release  it s hard to be optimistic about a very slight bump in sales  The stock has had a good rebound following news of a collaboration with Intel subsidiary Mobileye  but I think investors interested in this Chinese company should be very cautious until NIO gives us a clear picture of its financial situation and prospects ",2019-12-09,The Motley Fool,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/09/nio-november-2019-sales.aspx?source=iedfolrf0000001,2037108

41,221556,NIO,With racing and music events  Tesla gets over marketing allergy in China,news,"By Yilei Sun and Alexandria Sage
SHANGHAI SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Tesla Inc  O TSLA  has always shown disdain for marketing  with CEO Elon Musk boasting his company does not advertise  instead using the money it would have spent to develop products 
But in China  the world s biggest electric vehicle market where Tesla is gearing up for a major sales push  that tune has started to change as the automaker promotes racing events  showroom parties with DJs and a line of Chinese Tesla stickers for chat apps 
Case in point  Wang Yubo  a 30 year old marketing executive and Tesla car owner  was invited by the company to burnish his driving skills at a Shanghai racing track this month 
 I learned how to push my Model 3 to its limits   said Wang  who writes both enthusiastic and critical blogs about Tesla and occasionally races his car with friends 
Tesla is expanding its focus beyond products to service  says Leo Liu  head of the company s China driving school which aims to teach people  to make full use of their cars  
It held three such events for auto reporters  social media influencers and a handful of owners in August   one in Beijing and two in Shanghai and plans to expand to other big cities such as Guangzhou and Chengdu 
 We are also thinking of having more difficult ones on ice tracks in winter this year   Liu said  adding that more owners will be invited in the future 
While Tesla hasn t embarked on conventional TV or billboard advertising  the U S  firm s China Chief Tom Zhu has been working on strategies this year to boost the brand s appeal  frequently seeking ideas and opinions from marketing and sales experts  sources familiar with the discussions said 
The sources were not authorized to speak to the media and declined to be identified  Tesla declined to comment 
BIG FACTORY  BIG PLANS
Helping raise his profile in China  Musk is currently visiting the country and on Thursday held a discussion with Alibaba s  N BABA  Jack Ma at an AI industry event  although they avoided controversial issues like the U S  China trade war 
Tesla s new efforts to reach customers in China come as the Silicon Valley automaker is preparing to open a big vehicle assembly factory in Shanghai and confront fierce competition in the luxury electric vehicle market it invented 
The firm s first overseas factory is due to start production by the end of the year and Tesla has said it should be able to build 3 000 Model 3 vehicles a week in its initial phases 
That would translate to nearly four times the number of imported Model 3 vehicles sold in China per month this year  according to figures from research firm LMC Automotive 
The plant is slated to have annual output capacity of 250 000 vehicles after production of the Model Y is added 
 We have to learn how to manage a larger sales and after sales system as production is growing to a completely different level   said one source   That s why we are doing these events now  
The sources added  however  that Tesla is spending far less than what a conventional carmaker in China would be spending on marketing 
In Tesla s favor  it has been exporting cars to China since 2014 and remains the benchmark that other automakers in China often compare their electric vehicles to when they advertise 
The launch of the Model 3 for the Chinese market in late February has also gone well  sending Tesla s China revenue jumping 42  to  1 5 billion in the first half   equivalent to 13 5  of total revenue 
But Tesla in China doesn t have the headstart in all electric vehicles that it had in the U S  market when it debuted the Model S in 2012 
Chinese startup Nio Inc  N NIO  sells two premium all electric SUVs  Jaguar has launched is I PACE SUV and BMW  DE BMWG  has its i3 hatchback and i8 sportscar  By the end of the year  Audi will have two all electric SUVs on the market while Daimler s  DE DAIGn  Mercedes will have one 
The U S firm also doesn t expect Musk s cult status to propel sales to the same extent it does elsewhere  the sources said 
Most Chinese do not have easy access to his Twitter feed followed by nearly 28 million  although Tesla translates some of his less controversial tweets on its Weibo account 
In addition to chat app stickers that express various emotions   a market strategy also used by other automakers   Tesla is partnering with Tencent s  HK 0700  QQ Music streaming service in organizing parties with DJs at showrooms 
Both marketing tactics are China only developments  the sources said 
Social media users have noticed much more activity on Tesla s Weibo account in recent months while company has also held several roundtables with reporters and internet influencers throughout China since July 
According to sources  executives explained pricing strategy and expansion plans for its charging network and said they wanted to improve communication with the public 
By contrast  in the United States Tesla rarely grants media access to its executives beyond earnings calls and product launches 




 Tesla has finally realized the importance of adjusting to China   said Wang   Given time  it will become more mature  ",2019-08-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/with-racing-and-music-events-tesla-gets-over-marketing-allergy-in-china-1967031,1967031

44,221559,NIO,Nio  Mobileye partner on self driving consumer passenger cars in China,news,"By Tina Bellon
 Reuters    Chinese electric car startup Nio Inc  N NIO  and Intel Corp s  O INTC  self driving car technology firm Mobileye  F 0ME  on Tuesday said they would partner to develop autonomous vehicles for the consumer market in China and eventually other countries 
Under the agreement  Nio will manufacture and produce at mass scale a self driving system designed by Mobileye  which will be integrated into Nio s electric vehicle consumer lines  as well as Mobileye s driverless ride hailing services 
The self driving kit provided by Israel based Mobileye includes the vision processing chip  camera  radar and lidar sensors  as well as safety and mapping software 
Nio will also develop a version of self driving electric vehicles that Mobileye will deploy as robotaxis for ride hailing services in global markets 
No financial details of the partnership were disclosed 
The companies plan an initial release in China beginning in 2022  Mobileye President and Chief Executive Officer Amnon Shashua told Reuters in an interview on Monday 
 The deal with Nio will also enable us to harvest data in compliance with Chinese regulations and improve mapping to support autonomous driving   Shashua said 
The Mobileye CEO added that a rollout in China was more efficient as the regulatory environment was centralized and the Chinese government was working on standardizing Mobileye s safety model for self driving cars into law 
Manufacturers and suppliers are increasingly skeptical about the speed of adoption of fully automated self driving systems  because of their high cost  complexity  and regulatory hurdles 
In the meantime  they have begun focusing on deploying more advanced driver assistance systems  ADAS   which share components  but cost much less and can generate much needed revenue to help defray the cost of developing full self driving systems 
Mobileye on Tuesday said it powers ADAS in car models of more than 27 automakers

49,221564,NIO,StockBeat  Nio in Sharp Reverse on Wider Than Expected Loss,news,"Investing com   Nio slid sharply on Wednesday after the China based electric automaker reported a wider than expected loss  blaming a slowdown in China and weaker SUV demand 
NIO  NYSE NIO  reported a fourth quarter loss per share of 3 37 renminbi   wider than the 2 22 billion loss per share consensus  according to estimates from Investing com  Revenue for the quarter came in at 3 44 billion renminbi  beating expectations of 2 91 billion 
The electric automaker blamed the loss on a slowdown in deliveries  particularly for its ES8  an SUV launched last year in the Chinese market  as demand waned and Chinese consumers held back from auto purchases amid a slowdown in the economy 
 Deliveries of the ES8 in January and February 2019 were 1 805 and 811 vehicles respectively  which reflect a greater than anticipated slowdown in monthly deliveries compared to December 2018   Nio said 
The company also suffered an overhang from accelerated deliveries toward the end of last year  when Chinese consumers rushed to buy electric vehicles to beat the electric vehicle subsidy that went into effect this year 
In a sign that optimism may have soured  the company slammed the brakes on the plans to open a factory in Shanghai  raising concerns that slowing auto sales in China are set to continue 
The electric automaker s deeper than expected swerve into the red also prompted some on Wall Street to turn bearish 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch dropped Nio to an underperform rating from neutral  citing the company s downgraded forecast for shipments 
For the first quarter  Nio is expecting ES8 delivery to be between 3 500 and 3 800 vehicles  a decrease of 56  to 52  from fourth quarter  The company guided revenue between 1 39 billion renminbi and 1 52 billion renminbi  which would be about 60  to 56  lower year on year ",2019-03-06,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/marketpulse-nio-in-sharp-reverse-on-widerthanexpected-loss-1799694,1799694

Trump s threats reportedly prompted China to scrap this week s scheduled round of trade talks  consistent with its policy of refusing to negotiate  with a gun to its head   The Wall Street Journal reported that a trade delegation would fly to Washington as planned 
It wasn t clear  however  whether vice premier Liu He would head the delegation  as scheduled  Liu s absence would make it harder for the delegation to make any top level decisions and thus possibly push back further the timeline for a possible resolution to the dispute between the two countries 
The tweets came as a surprise after officials close to the talks had briefed about gradual progress and dangled the possibility of a summit at the end of May to sign off on a deal

Trump s intervention came only 48 hours after another solid employment report damped hopes of any near term interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve  Three senior Fed officials may offer their interpretation of that report when they speak later Monday

56,221571,NIO,Ford  Zayo Group  Nio Sidestep Selloff,news,"Investing com   Ford  Zayo Group and Nio offered a semblance of safety heading into the close Monday in the midst of broad based selling 
Ford Motor Company  NYSE F  rose 2  after German automaker VW confirmed the two brands would jointly develop electric vehicles or autonomous driving  but denied rumours that a merger between the two companies was in the making 
VW CEO Diess said Monday the joint development of commercial vehicles was  core to the alliance   but denied the partnership would lead to a full merger with Ford  claiming  that was never the objective of our talks  
Fibre optic provider Group Holdings Inc  NYSE ZAYO  shares surged 10  following a Bloomberg report that an investor group led by Blackstone  NYSE BX  and Stonepeak may be interested in making an offer for the company 
The uptick in Zayo comes after a prolonged period of mostly sideways action in the wake its quarterly results  which fell short of consensus estimates  though Wells Fargo said the weakness was somewhat overdone 
 While we understand the company fell short of the September quarter expectations and management credibility is at an all time low  the market s reaction seems a bit extreme given that Zayo remains the largest independent owner of North American fiber assets   Wells Fargo said in a note to clients 
Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  rival  NIO Inc   NYSE NIO  rose 7  after Citron Research Andrew Left delivered an upbeat assessment of the electric automaker  claiming it is  not just a car company   but a lifestyle and brand that is  ready to disrupt

57,221572,NIO,Stocks   Dow Drops Nearly 400 Points as Apple Leads Tech Rout,news,"Investing com   A rout in Apple and Facebook  NASDAQ FB  Monday swept through tech  prompting a wave of selling across the broader market 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 1 56   the S P 500 fell 1 66   while the Nasdaq Composite fell 3 03  
Sentiment soured on FAANG stocks after investors digested a Wall Street Journal report that Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  was considering cutting production as demand for its newest slate of phones was not as strong as the company had hoped  Its shares fell 4  
The plunge in Apple sent shockwaves throughout shares of its suppliers  some of whom had cut their growth outlook last week  adding further pressure in tech 
Facebook  NASDAQ FB  also exacerbated the slide in the broader market as The Wall Street Journal reported that CEO Mark Zuckerberg may be driving out top executives  Its shares fell 6  
The report from the Journal  indicating further signs of turmoil for the social media giant  comes just days after the company had denied allegations that it had conspired to cover up Russian influence and propaganda on its platform 
Energy  meanwhile  also played a role in the selloff even as U S  oil prices settled higher  on potential European Union sanctions on Iran and possible OPEC production cuts 
In a sign of skittish sentiment on stocks  defensive sectors of the market like estate and utilities closed in positive territory for the day as investors sought refuge from riskier sectors 
Lingering optimism on U S  China trade was soiled  meanwhile  following Vice President Mike Pence s remarks Sunday  asserting that there would be no end to U S  charges on  250 billion worth of Chinese goods unless China changed its practices toward trade  Pence s comments come ahead of a crucial meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit slated for the end of November 
So far  the United States has slapped tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese goods  about half the value of U S  imports from the country  China has retaliated with tariffs on  110 billion worth of American exports 
On the economic front  investors had to contend with yet another report pointing to a slowdown in the U S  housing market  which did little to lift sentiment on equities 
The National Association of Home Builders Wells Fargo Housing Market Index fell eight points to 60 in November  That was the lowest reading since August 2016 
In corporate news  Tesla rival NIO  NYSE NIO  soared 9  after Citron Research Andrew Left delivered an upbeat assessment of the electric automaker  claiming it is  not just a car company   but a lifestyle and brand that is  ready to disrupt

of CES 2020With 4 500 companies bringing their innovations to CES from Jan 7 through 10  it gets really difficult to pick favorites  Especially because practically everything in technology seems to be a  consumer  item these days Gone are the days when a TCL 10 5G smartphone promising 5G at dramatically lower cost  or a Samsung  KS 005930  Galaxy Note 10 Lite with its big screen  S Pen  cameras and other features at a lower price point  would be particularly exciting  Today these announcements are viewed as what they are  part of the typical mark down in prices of all things tech  In 2020  they re accompanied by a kind of phone as a service offering called Teracube  for  39  its manufacturer will replace broken phones with near new refurbished versions during the 4 year warranty period  Mobile computing is also advancing with the first folding tablet  Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Fold   the first E Ink touchscreen  Lenovo ThinkBook Plus  and chromeboooks like Samsung Galaxy and Lenovo s IdeaPad Duet  There s also Intel s 12 inch foldable concept device called the Horseshoe Bend that really knows how to bend backward running on its just announced Tiger Lake mobile processors The IoT group is as large as it is impressive  Some of the more interesting announcements here are the Juno chiller that can chill a drink in a matter of minutes  in case you haven t refrigerated it and are also out of ice cubes   a  21 9 inch Lenovo Smart Frame designed for hanging on the wall  an in home water treatment plant that can recycle 85  of household water called Hydraloop  a garbage disposal

patients  Fitness products like the Amazfit HomeStudio  a smart treadmill  and Echelon Row were other interesting products in this group Robotics also made headway in 2020  with Reachy from Pollen Robotics and Samsung s piBo  Samsung also showcased a cute Ballie  a yellow ball  that moves around the house managing smart home gadgets  While not strictly a part of this group  Samsung also showed a version of its Neon artificial human being that it s still working on  These photo realistic digital avatars displaying human like appearance  intelligence and emotions can be super useful or downright creepy  but they won t be market ready for a while Drones have become a more or less common category at CES  This year will see shipment of PowerVision s PowerEgg X  an  899 camera drone for shooting aerial images  The quadcopter design  waterproof option and ability to transform into a handheld for 4K imaging and facial recognition capability makes it the perfect choice for outdoor trips  PowerVision s V Coptr Falcon bi copter may not make it to the market this year  But when it does  it will manage a flight time of 50 minutes  a 7 km transmission range  stable 4K video footage  extra eyes for obstacle avoidance and auto follow features for easy cinematic shots And while we re on the subject of cameras  the 360 degree version that caters to the AR VR world saw an impressive entry from veteran Insta360  The company s One R 360 degree is a truly modular design with the extra battery  dual lens 360 lens  4K wide angle lens and more all coming in modules Samsung is the front runner in TVs with its 47 inch 4K QLED Sero TV and Q950TS 8K bezel less design that outdoes 8K offerings from Sony and LG  But TV is going digital in a big way and lots of people are catching their video on streaming devices  That s the crowded market TiVO s Stream 4K is debuting In gaming  there s an attempt at improving accessibility and immersion  Razer s Kishi controller is designed to slip into your iPhone or select Android smartphone s USB C or lightning port  thus attaching its two thumbsticks  directional pad  ABXY buttons and four shoulder buttons to your phone and turning it into a Switch style handheld  Arcadeo s Gaming chair vibrates to the sound of the game you re playing and there are 10 different kinds of reactions promising a more immersive experience And staying on the topic of gaming  there s Advanced Micro Devices  Radeon RX 5600 XT GPU chips for 1080p gamers to play the latest games at full HD resolution and high frame rates  90 120  but at a lower cost and power consumption than last year s 5700  It will launch on Jan 21  Intel too is working on the graphics front  claiming that its new Xe graphics architecture offers discrete level integrated graphics The first Xe based discrete GPU  code named DG1was previewed at CES  Its10nm Core mobile processors  code named Tiger Lake will deliver  double digit performance gains    massive  artificial intelligence performance improvements  better graphics performance  and 4x the throughput of USB3  Intel also showed off its 3rd Generation Xeon Scalable processor that promises significant AI training acceleration and overall performance improvement of 60  NVIDIA had some exciting gaming announcements like its ray tracing technology  new 360Hz esports displays  etc but it s more important contributions were in autonomous vehicle driving  AV   This was a huge category within CES 2020 as the market gears up to take on the challenge  Some of the displays were too futuristic  but others look achievable NVIDIA s offering is technology behind the phenomenon  The DRIVE AGX Orin platform based around the Orin system on a chip  SoC  is 7X faster than the previous generation Xavier  It s the first of a scalable platform for AVs that will formally launch in 2022  DRIVE facilitates data collection  model training  simulations and learning in the real world and the company is opening up the platform to all AV players so learnings experiences can be shared  This pooled information should make the system highly robust and get AVs to market sooner Qualcomm announced a new AV platform called Snapdragon Ride including SoCs  accelerators  software including open stacks  SDKs and other tools that can also be scaled from L1 to L5 levels  The thermally efficient  software focused platform with its centralized architecture is designed to help AV partners bring their cars to market sooner  no matter where they are in their development cycle  The software stack offers modules like Perception  Localization  Sensor Fusion and Behavior Planning  The new Car to Cloud service that can push out over the air updates and collect data should further spur AV builds Some of the futuristic vehicles include Honda s unnamed concept car  Centoventi concept car that seems to be sort of modular  Sony s Vision S  focused on large screens and entertainment   Toyota s LQ Level 4 concept car and Audi s unnamed AV concept with an actual desk option where the steering wheel should have been  Uber Hyundai s flying taxi concept was novel but probably impractical  we ll have to see how it goes  Smart scooters were also an attraction 5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020  Each comes from a different

81,221596,UBER,Buy Starbucks  SBUX  Stock Now For Strong 2020 Growth ,opinion,"Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX   shares have climbed 8  since it reported its Q4 2019 results at the end of October  Despite the climb  which some might have expected to be higher given its strong comparable sales growth  Starbucks stock rests roughly 9  below its 52 week highs 
Cold   Digital Growth 
Starbucks posted 5  global comps growth in the fourth quarter  which topped analysts  expectations by over 1   The international coffee giant s sales growth was driven by the U S  and China  with same store sales up 6  and 5   respectively  SBUX s strength in its two key markets helped overall sales jump 7  
Iced coffee and other cold drinks shined during the quarter  Investors should note that cold drinks now account for about half Starbucks  beverage sales  Going forward  the category is likely to continue to drive sales as younger customers flock to the offerings  which also includes teas  nitro cold brews  and more 
Starbucks hopes to continue to expand its business in China  which includes partnerships with Alibaba   NYSE BABA    as it fights off encroachment from local upstart Luckin Coffee Inc    NASDAQ LK    In the U S   the company ramped up delivery through Uber Eats   NYSE UBER    The Seattle giant s digital ordering business has also boomed  especially in cities  Meanwhile  its loyalty rewards program membership grew 15  to 17 6 million active members 
The firm s e commerce  delivery  and other digital initiatives will play vital roles for years to come as the industry  from rivals Dunkin    NASDAQ DNKN   and McDonald s   NYSE MCD   to fast casual firms like Chipotle   NYSE CMG    moves more in that direction 
 
 
 
 
Other Fundamentals 
As we can see  SBUX shares have climbed over 50  in the last two years  which tops the S P 500 s 17   its industry s 26  average  and DNKN s 22   The stock is up 44  in the past year but only 1  in the last six months  Starbucks stock closed regular trading Monday at  91 08 a share  down about 9  off its 52 week highs  which could give the stock room to run heading into its Q1 fiscal 2020 earnings release 
SBUX is trading at 28 7X forward 12 month earnings estimates  This marks a premium compared to its industry s 24 8X and its own three year low of 18 6X  But investors have been willing to pay more for Starbucks for nearly all of the last decade and it has traded as high as 32 2X as recently as July 2019 
Meanwhile  the company returned  12 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2019 through buybacks and dividends  The firm also raised its quarterly dividend by 14  to  0 41 per share for 2020 to help its yield rest at 1 82  at the moment  which roughly matches the 10 year U S  Treasury and Walmart   NYSE WMT    
 
 
 
 
Outlook 
Looking ahead  our Zacks estimates call for Starbucks  Q1 fiscal 2020 revenue to jump 6 8  to reach  7 08 billion  The firm s full year sales are projected to pop 7 1  to  28 38 billion  with 2021 expected to come in another 7 7  higher  These would both roughly match 2019 s 7 2  top line growth 
On top of that  our Key Company Metrics call for its comps to pop 3 6   This would come on top of last year s 5  same store sales growth and top 2018 and 2017 s 3  comparable store sales growth

82,221597,UBER,The Best Of CES 2020  Revised ,opinion,With 4 500 companies bringing their innovations to CES from Jan 7 through 10  it gets really difficult to pick favorites  Especially because practically everything in technology seems to be a  consumer  item these days Gone are the days when a TCL 10 5G smartphone promising 5G at dramatically lower cost  or a Samsung  KS 005930  Galaxy Note 10 Lite with its big screen  S Pen  cameras and other features at a lower price point  would be particularly exciting  Today these announcements are viewed as what they are  part of the typical mark down in prices of all things tech  In 2020  they re accompanied by a kind of phone as a service offering called Teracube  for  39  its manufacturer will replace broken phones with near new

etc   and the ExoBeam walking aid for Parkinsons patients  Fitness products like the Amazfit HomeStudio  a smart treadmill  and Echelon Row were other interesting products in this group Robotics also made headway in 2020  with Reachy from Pollen Robotics and Samsung s piBo  Samsung also showcased a cute Ballie  a yellow ball  that moves around the house managing smart home gadgets  While not strictly a part of this group  Samsung also showed a version of its Neon artificial human being that it s still working on  These photo realistic digital avatars displaying human like appearance  intelligence and emotions can be super useful or downright creepy  but they won t be market ready for a while  Drones have become a more or less common category at CES  This year will see shipment of

gaming announcements like its ray tracing technology  new 360Hz esports displays  etc but its more important contributions were in autonomous vehicle driving  AV   This was a huge category within CES 2020 as the market gears up to take on the challenge  Some of the displays were too futuristic  but others look achievable  NVIDIA s offering is technology behind the phenomenon  The DRIVE AGX Orin platform based around the Orin system on a chip  SoC  is 7X faster than the previous generation Xavier  It s the first of a scalable platform for AVs that will formally launch in 2022  DRIVE facilitates data collection  model training  simulations and learning in the real world and the company is opening up the platform to all AV players so learnings experiences can be shared  This pooled information should make the system highly robust and get AVs to market sooner Qualcomm   NASDAQ QCOM   announced a new AV platform called Snapdragon Ride including SoCs  accelerators  software including open stacks  SDKs and other tools that can also be scaled from L1 to L5 levels  The thermally efficient  software focused platform with its centralized architecture is designed to help AV partners bring their cars to market sooner  no matter where they are in their development cycle  The software stack offers modules like Perception  Localization  Sensor Fusion and Behavior Planning  The new Car to Cloud service that can push out over the air updates and collect data should further spur AV builds Some of the futuristic vehicles include Honda s unnamed concept car  Centoventi

83,221598,UBER,Near Term Bumps In Transport Services Industry Outlook,opinion,The companies housed in Zacks industry offer logistics  leasing and maintenance services to transporters Some of the industry participants focus on the business of global logistics management  including international freight forwarding and consolidation  for both air and ocean freight  The third party logistics  3PL  companies offer innovative supply chain solutions  They also focus on services like product sourcing  warehousing and freight shipping Apart from renting out vehicles  car rental companies in the space are engaged in the sale of value added products and services  Some of these companies also offer domestic and international express delivery services Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes Sluggish freight shipments are unwelcome transport service providers  In fact  according to the latest Cass Freight Shipments Index report  North American freight shipments declined for 13 consecutive months starting from December 2018  Weak pricing and soft freight volumes have been denting the top lines of industry participants  Even though the situation might improve in 2020  particularly due to tariff relief following the signing of the U S  China Phase 1 trade deal  significant growth in terms of freight volumes is not expected at least in the near term  Increased costs and escalated debts are impeding growth prospects of most of these transport service providers  As evidence  operating expenses increased 4 2  in the first nine months of 2019 at Expeditors International of Washington  EXPD   Operating expenses are likely to have been high in the December quarter as well mainly due to higher labor costs  Moreover  car rental companies like Hertz Global Holdings  HTZ  are suffering from pricing pressure due to low used car prices  Moreover  the presence of players like Uber  NYSE UBER  and Lyft  NASDAQ LYFT  is a major threat to the need for car rental services  The impressive balance sheets of most major companies in the space have enabled them to engage in shareholder friendly activities  For instance  in December 2019  the Minnesota based freight broker C H  Robinson Worldwide  CHRW  announced an increase in its quarterly dividend by 2  to 51 cents a share   2 04 annually  from 50 cents   2 annually   Some transport service providers are also active on the buyback front  Moreover  low tax rates are supporting bottom line growth at most of these companies Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy ProspectsThe Zacks Transportation Services industry is a 24 stock group within the broader Zacks sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  188  which places it at the bottom 26  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bleak near term prospects Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Since January 2019  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has gone down 45  Despite the lackluster near term prospects of the industry  we will present a few stocks that one can buy given their growth prospects  But it s worth taking a look at the industry s shareholder returns and current valuation first Industry Lags Sector and S P 500The Zacks Transportation Services industry has underperformed both the broader Transportation Sector and the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year The industry has gained 11 6  in a year s time compared with the S P 500 s appreciation of 23 9   Meanwhile  the broader sector has appreciated 11 8  One Year Price Performance Industry s Current ValuationOn the basis of trailing 12 month enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA   which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Transportation services stocks  the industry is currently trading at 13 06X compared with the S P 500 s 12 12X  It is also higher than the sector s trailing 12 month EV EBITDA of 7 90X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 21 45X  as low as 9 69X and at the median of 12 78X Trailing 12 Month Enterprise Value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio  Bottom LineEven though the recently signed Phase 1 trade deal between the world s two largest economic superpowers bodes well  significant growth in terms of freight volumes is not expected in the near term  Also  headwinds like increased costs and high debt levels are likely to impede growth for participants in the Zacks Transportation Services industry However  shareholder friendly activities of most industry participants should add to their financial strength  In fact  we have zeroed in on three stocks  carrying either a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   which are well positioned to grow despite challenges  You can see  Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte  S  A  B  de C  V   OMAB  is based in Mexico  The company operates and manages multiple international airports in the north and central regions of Mexico  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 EPS has been revised 4 5  upward over the past 60 days  The stock sports a Zacks Rank  1 Price and Consensus  OMABGrupo Aeroportuario del

84,221599,UBER,10 Trends That Will Shape The U S  And Gold Market In 2020,opinion,"What will 2020 be like  Well  as a leap year  it will be longer than 2019  but the rest is a mystery  However  let s point out a few important trends that will shape the U S  economy and the gold market this year 

Inflation should remain subdued 
The same applies to GDP growth  although global growth could bottom out 
The Fed will be in a wait and see mode  but with a dovish bias 
The ECB and the BoJ will remain accommodative 
U S  dollar should stay strong 
The U S  fiscal policy will remain easy 
Trade wars will be softer with a phase one trade deal signed 
The uncertainty regarding Brexit should also diminish  as Conservatives won a majority in December parliamentary election 
Thus  investors could increase their appetite for risky assets 
Bond yields have room to move higher in 2020 

We will analyze them as we believe that investors need a clear guide to navigate through choppy waters of our turbulent economy  Without a broader fundamental perspective  it s easy to drown in the sea of conflicting and exaggerated headlines 
First  inflation should remain subdued  as low inflation is not transitory but more of a permanent phenomenon due to global competition  technological progress  and disruptors such as Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Uber  NYSE UBER  
Second  the U S  GDP growth is expected to slow down  falling from 2 4 percent in 2019 to 2 1 percent in 2020  according to the IMF  or even below 2 percent  according to other forecasters  However  with eased trade disputes and global growth possibly bottoming out  the U S  economic growth could surprise on the upside 
Third  given subdued inflation  the Fed is unlikely to hike the federal funds rate in 2020  The latest dot plot suggests a pause this year  which would imply a more hawkish stance than in 2019 when we witnessed three interest rate cuts  However  the possible economic slowdown or even more serious economic developments  could prompt the U S  central bank to take some dovish actions 
Fourth  both the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan will remain accommodative  So  even if the Fed pauses this year  it will be more hawkish than other major central banks  which should support the US dollar at the expense of gold  The growth  while anemic  will also be higher in the U S  than in other G7 countries 
Fifth  as far the U S  economy outperforms its major peers  even if it marks the slowdown  the greenback should remain strong  exerting some downward pressure on the yellow metal 
Sixth  the U S  fiscal policy will stay accommodative  The fiscal deficit is forecasted to increase from  1 092 to  1 101 billion  However  relative to GDP  the fiscal deficit is expected to decrease from 5 2 to 4 8 percent  according to the presidential projections  Abstracting from details  the fiscal stance will remain similar to last year s 
Seventh  as the U S  and China have reached a preliminary agreement in their long running trade dispute  the worries about the full blown trade war should ease  and confidence could return to the markets 
Eight  the Conservative party secured a large majority in the December UK Parliamentary elections  It means that Brexit will likely occur by the end of January  No matter how one views Brexit  the great uncertainty is now removed and businesses can implement their investment plans once again 
Ninth  as two big geopolitical headwinds receded somewhat  investors  risk appetite could increase  so they will probably allocate more funds into equities  at the expense of gold and other safe haven assets 
Tenth  indeed  if investors increase their appetite for risky assets  they will shift their funds from the Treasuries into the stock market  Lower demand due to eased recession fears and higher supply due to higher fiscal deficit could drive down the bond prices  increasing their yields  Higher interest rates would be negative for gold prices  As the chart below shows  the price of gold peaked in 2019 when the 10 year Treasury yield bottomed out  So  if the yields increase further  gold should continue its downward trend 







Chart 1  Gold prices  yellow line  left axis  London P M  Fix  in    and nominal yields on 10 year US Treasury  red line  right axis  in    from January to December 2019  
The above trends are  unfortunately  not very supportive for gold prices  The fiscal policy will be similarly easy  while the monetary policy will be more hawkish than in 2019  supporting the U S  dollar  The geopolitical headwinds have softened  which should support the risky assets and bond yields  So  we could see strong dollar  higher real interest rates and lower risk aversion   a very bad combination for the price of gold  Hence  from a fundamental point of view  2020 may be a worse year for gold than 2019  Unless  of course  something really bad happens  such as for example  the next economic crisis arrives ",2020-01-17,Arkadiusz Sieron,https://www.investing.com/analysis/10-trends-that-will-shape-the-us-and-gold-market-in-2020-200499705,200499705

As part of the initiatives to drive growth  Khosrowshah indicated the focus for Uber would shift from discounting to investing in technology that would bring down costs 
When entering new markets  ride hailing businesses like Uber have often used bonuses and discounts to recruit drivers and passengers 
Uber s efforts to turn a profit appear to have drawn a mixed response on Wall Street  Just last week  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  was reported to have sold its entire stake iUber in the fourth quarter  CNBC reported  citing a person with direct knowledge of the move

Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  has seen huge gains in recent months  and that has perhaps emboldened the car company to stand up to federal regulators in denying allegations regarding its vehicles  Meanwhile  Uber  NYSE UBER  has also seen a sizable recovery since November following poor performance after the ridesharing specialist s IPO  and some see strategic moves that it s making as potentially building more positive momentum 
Tesla to regulators   Completely false 
Shares of Tesla rose 6  after the electric vehicle specialist took an aggressive approach in responding to allegations that its cars are unsafe  In addition to challenging the validity of claims made in a regulatory petition  Tesla asserted that the person making the claim was a short seller of the company s stock 

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  received a petition last September requesting that the regulator recall Tesla vehicles made in 2013 or later  The petition alleged that the electric cars have higher rates of unintended acceleration than other vehicles  Last Friday  the NHTSA said it would formally review the petition 
A Tesla blog post responded by noting that the car company had already discussed with the agency most of the past incidents that the petition cited  In all those cases  Tesla said  the vehicle functioned properly  Moreover  the manufacturer noted that proprietary Tesla technology offers advantages over other vehicles with respect to accelerator function 
Investors have seen similar allegations before  and the way that Tesla handled this latest assertion without undue drama seems to reflect changes that the company has made internally  With some stock analysts seeing considerably more upside for Tesla  shareholders have a lot to be excited about 
Uber makes a sale
Meanwhile  shares of Uber rose 5   The company made a strategic move with some of its operations in India  and it s also testing a feature to give some of its drivers more autonomy to set prices 
On the strategic side  Uber announced that it would sell off its Uber Eats business in India to industry peer Zomato  Rather than continuing to compete in the hotly contested market in that country  Uber will take a nearly 10  stake in Zomato  It will also support Zomato by including some operational assets as part of the deal 
Elsewhere  Uber is offering a test that allows some of its drivers in California to charge fares that they set themselves  rather than requiring them to charge whatever fare Uber determines is appropriate  The move will affect airport trips in Palm Springs  Sacramento  and Santa Barbara  giving the flexibility to charge up to five times the normal Uber provided rate  The test is intended to demonstrate to California regulators that Uber is respecting the independent contractor status of its drivers rather than imposing employee like restrictions on them 
By culling weak performing businesses and answering regulatory challenges  Uber is looking to get back some momentum  Its stock has already seen the positive effects  but there needs to be more progress in order to satisfy IPO investors who still have losses on their positions ",2020-01-22,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pkxb-,2064067

91,221606,UBER,Goldman CEO says process on canceled WeWork IPO  worked ,news,"By Greg Roumeliotis
DAVOS  Switzerland  Reuters    Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  Chief Executive David Solomon called WeWork s abandoned initial public offering  IPO  a great example of the listing process working on Tuesday  even if was  not as pretty as everybody would like it to be  
Goldman was one of investment banks that would have led the IPO last year  after convincing the office space sharing start up it could improve on the  47 billion valuation in a private fundraising round it secured in January 2019 
The IPO was canceled after investors raised questions about WeWork s valuation and corporate governance arrangements that gave its co founder Adam Neumann too much control 
WeWork ended up facing a cash crunch  and was rescued by shareholder SoftBank Group Corp in October in a  9 5 billion deal that gave the Japanese group majority control 
 The banks were not valuing  WeWork   Banks give you a model  You say to the company  well  if you can prove to us that the model actually does what it does  then it s possible that the company is worth this in the public markets   Solomon said 
WeWork was considering a valuation of as low as  10 billion and  12 billion at the time it was preparing for an IPO in September  Reuters reported at the time 
Solomon told a conference panel at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum  WEF  in Davos  Switzerland that the process worked because due diligence and feedback by potential IPO investors  ground it in reality  
While 2019 had promised to be a bumper year for IPOs  investor confidence fizzled out  Shares of some high profile start ups such as Uber Technologies  NYSE UBER  Inc and  Lyft  Inc  NASDAQ LYFT  languished in the months following their listings  A few companies  such as WeWork  canceled their stock market debuts  because of investor pushback against their valuations 
 If you bought a package of all the IPOs that came to market in 2019 I think you returned 34  and outperformed the broader market a little bit  But there were companies that did not perform well and did not meet the expectations that were set   Solomon said 
Cheap money  driven by low interest rates  is pushing investors to take risks  and this has led them to overvalue some companies  growth projections and not focus on their underlying earnings  Solomon said 
Solomon added that the fact that Saudi Aramco s  29 4 billion IPO attracted primarily domestic  rather than international  investors last month was because the valuation pitched to them on the local exchange was not attractive enough ",2020-01-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/goldman-ceo-says-process-on-canceled-wework-ipo-worked-2064137,2064137

Investing com    Wall Street edged lower in early trade on Tuesday but pared premarket losses caused by a global wave of selling on fears of a possible epidemic in China 
Authorities have now confirmed six deaths from the so called coronavirus  a pneumonia like disease that is capable of being transmitted from person to person  The outbreak  which started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan  has shown signs of spreading throughout the country  triggering fears of a repeat of the 2002 SARS epidemic 
Airline stocks were particularly hard hit  with the ADRs of China Eastern  NYSE CEA  and China Southern  NYSE ZNH Airlines fell 11 2  and 9 6  respectively on fears that an epidemic could hit passenger traffic  United Airlines  NASDAQ UAL  stock was the worst hit U S  flyer  falling 2 6   while Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  stock fell 1 6  and American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL  stock fell 2 0  by 10 AM ET  1500 GMT  
The Dow Jones Industrial Index lost 41 points  or 0 1   while the S P 500 fell 8 points  or 0 2  and the Nasdaq Composite also fell 0 1  
Elsewhere  Uber  NYSE UBER  rose 2 8  to its highest since August after announcing it would retreat from its loss making food delivery business in India  It s selling the business to local rival Zomato in return for a 9 99  stake that will allow it to reap any eventual upside to a market that has yet to deliver decent returns

96,221611,UBER,Iran Fears Ease  So Focus Turns To Jobs  Fed Speakers  Earnings,opinion," Thursday Market Open  And now back to your regularly scheduled programming  
At least that s the way it feels early Thursday  with the market riding higher in pre market trading as geopolitical fears ease and investors contemplate news of China s vice premier heading to Washington next week for a trade deal signing ceremony 
Crude  which fell below  60 a barrel for the first time in almost a month yesterday  is trading right around that level this morning  It s down from highs above  65 earlier this week when concerns about Iran peaked 
All the positives might outweigh some of the negatives  including Kohl s  NYSE KSS  shares falling nearly 6  overnight that same store sales fell  0 2  in November and December  J C  Penney  NYSE JCP  shares fell  too  on disappointing holiday sales  This follows a slight sales drop for Macy s  NYSE M   so the year starts with more disappointment at the mall  it seems 
Meanwhile  Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  is down double digits in pre market trading after earnings missed expectations and the company withdrew its outlook for the year  So far  it hasn t been a good day for retail  As much as we hear about the consumer being healthy  it looks like some stores are struggling  However  in retail  it s often an individual story for each company  so a tough quarter for some might be a great one for others  
Turnaround Wednesday Turnaround Tuesday came one day late this week  but bullish traders probably welcomed it anyway  After every sector fell on Tuesday  all sectors but one rose on Wednesday as Iran and the U S  walked back from confrontation  Markets pared their gains in the last minutes yesterday after word of missiles hitting Baghdad  A day later  it looks like that particular fear might have been overblown  but it does point out how skittish the market remains Though Wednesday might have come as a relief to anyone who was on the edge of their seat watching the news Tuesday night  we re not necessarily out of the geopolitical woods yet  The latest developments seem encouraging  but the Middle East is still a potential flash point that could keep people on edge over the next few weeks  It s probably a good idea to keep positions a bit smaller than usual  even though volatility has declined  With some of the fear banished at least for one session  a few  defensive  parts of the market went into retreat Wednesday  Namely bonds  where the 10 year yield jumped all the way up to 1 87  by the end of the day  It had fallen below 1 8  a few days back as bonds rallied  Gold also took a step back after climbing above  1 600 an ounce earlier Wednesday  its highest level in nearly seven years  Semiconductor stocks helped lead the gains through most of the day Wednesday  but fell from their highs in the last hour  This might have been profit taking  because the sector has been rolling up new highs for weeks  It s quite a change from a year ago when chip makers looked like they were on the ropes  in part due to inventory issues  Those issues appear to now be behind  at least for many companies Energy Misses The PartyThe sector that didn t react positively to the Iran news  Energy  Some of the heaviest losses occurred in shares of oil producers like Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  and oil field services companies like Halliburton  NYSE HAL   Those two took haircuts of 1 5  to 2 5  as U S  crude futures slipped below  60 a barrel for the first time since Dec  15 intraday 
As we noted here a few days ago  crude seems to have its work cut out for it if it s going to test  70 a barrel for the first time since 2018  Even the military skirmishes in the Middle East didn t really get prices too close  A surprise gain in U S  weekly supplies reported Wednesday by the government didn t help  either  Now crude is just trying to hold  60 
The blow to crude looked like a relief for transport stocks  with many airline and shipping company shares rising Wednesday and the Dow Jones Transportation Average  DJT  posting gains of nearly 1   The DJT  sometimes thought of as a leading indicator  lags the S P 500 Index  DJT  by quite a bit over the last year despite generally low crude prices and solid consumer demand  With some exceptions  shipping  railroad  and airline shares haven t enjoyed the same sort of rally as the broader market since a year ago  see chart below   
Earnings  Fed Speakers  Jobs All Straight AheadMore earnings are straight ahead  and many analysts expect continued softness from Q4 results  The latest estimate from S P Global Market Intelligence is for a 2  earnings per share drop among S P 500 companies in Q4  The firm expects things to improve in Q1 with 3 7  growth and sees full year 2020 gains of 7 8  
Data today look a little light  with everyone getting ready for tomorrow morning s non farm payrolls figure  Consensus on Wall Street is for a December job gain of 160 000  according to Briefing com  down from 266 000 in November  Keep in mind  however  that the November figure might have gotten artificially inflated by General Motors  NYSE GM  employees returning to work after a strike 
If tomorrow s headline number comes in as analysts expect  it would represent very solid growth not far from the long term monthly average  Remember that even job gains of 100 000 a month would probably be enough to keep up with population growth  economists say  Weekly jobless claims of 214 000 reported Thursday morning were unremarkable from a statistical standpoint  
It s been a while since Fed speakers were on the agenda  but a bunch of them appear today  The list includes Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari  New York Fed President John Williams  Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin  Chicago Fed President Charles Evans  and St  Louis Fed President James Bullard 
It might be tough to keep track of it all  but we ll see if any of them have something illuminating to say about the economy  The next Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  meeting is still a few weeks away

What Could Change in the 20s  Emerging market stocks struggled in the decade that just wrapped up even as U S  stocks soared to one record high after another  A commodities crash around mid decade and slowing Chinese growth both helped keep emerging markets down on the mat over the last 10 years  but now that might be changing  according to some analysts  Innovation has seemed focused in Western countries  one reason markets in the U S  and Europe have outpaced developing markets  However  Barron s reported recently that China  South Korea  and Taiwan are rivaling the West in the next wave of technology  including batteries  gene therapy  and telecommunications equipment  Improved financial infrastructure for start ups in China could also help developing markets in the decade to come  the article said  Easier access to the public market for these start ups could mean many private firms with  1 billion valuations appearing on stock exchanges over the next few years 
Soft IPO Market in Spotlight as Banks Report  Many of the big banks begin reporting next week  and one question mark for major investment banks is the initial public offerings  IPO  market  After new offerings swelled to nearly 20 year highs in the first half of 2019  several high profile disappointments appeared to clip IPO interest in the second half  That could potentially be a drag on bank profits  Most tech companies that went public closed 2019 below their first day opening prices and at least nine closed below their IPO prices  Shares of Uber  NYSE UBER   Lyft  NASDAQ LYFT   and Slack  NYSE WORK  ended the year down 40  from their first day opening prices  on average  The Wall Street Journal said  General weakness in the IPO market since the middle of last year might reflect growing reluctance among public investors to accept inflated private market valuations a sentiment that sharpened after the WeWork IPO flameout  the paper reported 
Musk Gets Praise  The recent rally to all time highs for Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  occurred as it successfully rolled out the Model 3  opened its plant in China  and surpassed the Street s production estimates  While all that is important  so is the company s ability to cut costs  said former GM executive Bob Lutz  interviewed on CNBC yesterday  As CNBC pointed out  Lutz has been a critic of Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk  On Wednesday  Lutz praised TSLA  saying   Tesla is finally being run like a normal business   He added   Musk finally reined in his costs  He s reduced personnel and reduced unnecessary expenditures and has basically done what any other businessman would do in a situation where you re selling a bunch of stuff but you re not profitable  on a sustained basis  Shares of TSLA raced to nearly 5  gains Wednesday and knocked on the door of  500 a share  The 52 week low was under  177

company is trailing DoorDash in terms of market share  Per the latest  by analytics firm Second Measure  Grubhub s share of the U S  consumers  meal delivery sales in November was 30   lower than DoorDash s 37   Moreover  Uber Eats earned 20  of the U S  meal delivery spending in the same month Moreover  Grubhub  that stiff competition and lower frequency as well as retention rates of new diners hurt third quarter 2019 overall results by more than 300 basis points  bps  Further  increasing expenses due to planned expansion into new delivery markets and higher investments in marketing and advertisements continued to keep the company s margins under pressure Shares of Grubhub have declined 32 4  in the past year against the s growth of 13 7  Why Should Amazon  Google be Interested Amazon s interest in food delivery is evident from its investment in the U K  based Deliveroo  Per Forbes   the online food delivery market is estimated to be worth  200 billion globally by 2025  and it is not surprising that Amazon is eyeing it Amazon s strong retail and cloud computing footprint provides it a steady source of revenues and profits  Moreover  Grubhub s acquisition will spare the need for immediate investments as the e commerce giant will get a well established food delivery network and an expanding restaurant partner base Notably  Grubhub s partner base now includes the likes of Yum Brands   Shake Shack  NYSE SHAK   Blue Apron  Dunkin  Brands Group  Yelp  Dine Brands  the parent company of Applebee s Neighborhood Grill   Bar and IHOP restaurants  McDonald s  NYSE MCD   and Panera Bread  NASDAQ PNRA  The combination of Amazon s distribution strength with Grubhub s expanding partner base can challenge the growing dominance of DoorDash and UBER in the U S  food delivery space Moreover  Google has already forayed into this market with its delivery arm  Wing  and food delivery apps  Notably  Wing has received permission from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in Australia and launched the food delivery service through drones in the country  the first of its kind in the world  Currently  the service is available in Canberra  which delivers food  coffee and

99,221614,UBER,The Best Of CES 2020,opinion,"With 4 500 companies bringing their innovations to CES from Jan 7 through 10  it gets really difficult to pick favorites  Especially because practically everything in technology seems to be a  consumer  item these days 
Gone are the days when a TCL 10 5G smartphone promising 5G at dramatically lower cost  or a Samsung  KS 005930  Galaxy Note 10 Lite with its big screen  S Pen  cameras and other features at a lower price point  would be particularly exciting  Today these announcements are viewed as what they are  part of the typical mark down in prices of all things tech  In 2020  they re accompanied by a kind of phone as a service offering called Teracube  for  39  its manufacturer will replace broken phones with near new refurbished versions during the 4 year warranty period  
Mobile computing is also advancing with the first folding tablet  Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Fold   the first E Ink touchscreen  Lenovo ThinkBook Plus  and chromeboooks like Samsung Galaxy and Lenovo s IdeaPad Duet  There s also Intel s 12 inch foldable concept device called the Horseshoe Bend that really knows how to bend backward running on its just announced Tiger Lake mobile processors 
The IoT group is as large as it is impressive  Some of the more interesting announcements here are the Juno chiller that can chill a drink in a matter of minutes  in case you haven t refrigerated it and are also out of ice cubes   a  21 9 inch Lenovo Smart Frame designed for hanging on the wall  an in home water treatment plant that can recycle 85  of household water called Hydraloop  a garbage disposal option that can separate compostable material called Sepura manufactured by Anvy Technologies  a device called GENNY  by Watergen that converts moisture in the air to drinking water 
Some of the IoT announcements are of a more personal kind  They include not just new versions of smartwatches like the Withings ScanWatch and the Suunto 7 Wear OS based smartwatch  but also an all new head band called Urgonight that s designed to help you sleep better  smart toothbrushes  Y brush and Colgate s Plaqless Pro   a smart bath mat that measures your weight  checks the way your feet stand on it and suggests better postures and exercises  an LED desk lamp called Lexilight to facilitate reading by dyslexia patients  a condition where you have two dominant eyes   several smart hearing aids that also offer noise cancellation and enable music streaming  hands free calling  determining the sounds you want to hear and the times you want to hear  etc   and the ExoBeam walking aid for Parkinsons patients  Fitness products like the Amazfit HomeStudio  a smart treadmill  and Echelon Row were other interesting products in this group 
Robotics also made headway in 2020  with Reachy from Pollen Robotics and Samsung s piBo  Samsung also showcased a cute Ballie  a yellow ball  that moves around the house managing smart home gadgets  While not strictly a part of this group  Samsung also showed a version of its Neon artificial human being that it s still working on  These photo realistic digital avatars displaying human like appearance  intelligence and emotions can be super useful or downright creepy  but they won t be market ready for a while 
Drones have become a more or less common category at CES  This year will see shipment of PowerVision s PowerEgg X  an  899 camera drone for shooting aerial images  The quadcopter design  waterproof option and ability to transform into a handheld for 4K imaging and facial recognition capability makes it the perfect choice for outdoor trips  PowerVision s V Coptr Falcon bi copter may not make it to the market this year  But when it does  it will manage a flight time of 50 minutes  a 7 km transmission range  stable 4K video footage  extra eyes for obstacle avoidance and auto follow features for easy cinematic shots 
And while we re on the subject of cameras  the 360 degree version that caters to the AR VR world saw an impressive entry from veteran Insta360  The company s One R 360 degree is a truly modular design with the extra battery  dual lens 360 lens  4K wide angle lens and more all coming in modules 
Samsung is the front runner in TVs with its 47 inch 4K QLED Sero TV and Q950TS 8K bezel less design that outdoes 8K offerings from Sony and LG  But TV is going digital in a big way and lots of people are catching their video on streaming devices  That s the crowded market TiVO s Stream 4K is debuting 
In gaming  there s an attempt at improving accessibility and immersion  Razer s Kishi controller is designed to slip into your iPhone or select Android smartphone s USB C or lightning port  thus attaching its two thumbsticks  directional pad  ABXY buttons and four shoulder buttons to your phone and turning it into a Switch style handheld  Arcadeo s Gaming chair vibrates to the sound of the game you re playing and there are 10 different kinds of reactions promising a more immersive experience 
And staying on the topic of gaming  there s Advanced Micro Devices    NASDAQ AMD   Radeon RX 5600 XT GPU chips for 1080p gamers to play the latest games at full HD resolution and high frame rates  90 120  but at a lower cost and power consumption than last year s 5700  It will launch on Jan 21  Intel   NASDAQ INTC   too is working on the graphics front  claiming that its new Xe graphics architecture offers discrete level integrated graphics 
The first Xe based discrete GPU  code named DG1was previewed at CES  Its10nm Core mobile processors  code named Tiger Lake will deliver  double digit performance gains    massive  artificial intelligence performance improvements  better graphics performance  and 4x the throughput of USB3  Intel also showed off its 3rd Generation Xeon Scalable processor that promises significant AI training acceleration and overall performance improvement of 60  
NVIDIA   NASDAQ NVDA   had some exciting gaming announcements like its ray tracing technology  new 360Hz esports displays  etc but its more important contributions were in autonomous vehicle driving  AV   This was a huge category within CES 2020 as the market gears up to take on the challenge  Some of the displays were too futuristic  but others look achievable 
NVIDIA s offering is technology behind the phenomenon  The DRIVE AGX Orin platform based around the Orin system on a chip  SoC  is 7X faster than the previous generation Xavier  It s the first of a scalable platform for AVs that will formally launch in 2022  DRIVE facilitates data collection  model training  simulations and learning in the real world and the company is opening up the platform to all AV players so learnings experiences can be shared  This pooled information should make the system highly robust and get AVs to market sooner 
Qualcomm   NASDAQ QCOM   announced a new AV platform called Snapdragon Ride including SoCs  accelerators  software including open stacks  SDKs and other tools that can also be scaled from L1 to L5 levels  The thermally efficient  software focused platform with its centralized architecture is designed to help AV partners bring their cars to market sooner  no matter where they are in their development cycle  The software stack offers modules like Perception  Localization  Sensor Fusion and Behavior Planning  The new Car to Cloud service that can push out over the air updates and collect data should further spur AV builds 
Some of the futuristic vehicles include Honda s unnamed concept car  Centoventi concept car that seems to be sort of modular  Sony s Vision S  focused on large screens and entertainment   Toyota s LQ Level 4 concept car and Audi s unnamed AV concept with an actual desk option where the steering wheel should have been  Uber   NYSE UBER   Hyundai s flying taxi concept was novel but probably impractical  we ll have to see how it goes  Smart scooters were also an attraction

100,221615,UBER,4 Restaurant Stocks For Appetizing Returns In 2020,opinion,Restaurant business is not for the faint of heart  Competition is fierce  profit margins are low and consumers  tastes and preferences change with time  Plus  time and again established brands somehow have been able to yield big gains for investors over the long run  But small scale businesses mostly struggle and many don t manage to survive Thanks to GrubHub and Uber  NYSE UBER  Eats  delivery services are currently on the rise  Such digital food ordering methods mean less foot traffic in many restaurant chains  eventually hurting bottom lines  Industry researcher TDn2K did confirm that there has been an all out decline in average foot traffic for years  dealing a blow to comparable store sales But despite such disappointing developments  it is the right time to pick some solid restaurant stocks  This is because such companies not only on an individual capacity have made the necessary changes to suit customers  desires  consumer spending on eating out has also been rising steadily for quite some time now  Particularly last year  money spent on eating out equaled that spent at grocery stores for the first time in the United States  according to the U S  Census Bureau And let s admit that the domestic economy is humming and consumers are pretty confident about their well being  which usually leads to folks eating out more often  The pace of U S  economic expansion picked up in the third quarter of 2019  Per the Bureau of Economic Analysis  the economy grew at an annualized rate of 2 1  in the three months ended Sep 30  2019  versus the initial estimate of 1 9  and 2  in the second quarter Separately  the U S  Conference Board s index of consumer confidence continues to remain high  as it came in at 126 5 for December  In fact  November s reading was raised from 125 5 to 126 8  Moreover  the index that shows how consumers feel about the economy right now rose 4 4 points to 170  But what made Americans feel so confident  It s a strong labor market and the lowest level of unemployment in a half century 4 Top Notch Restaurant Stocks to Buy NowIt will  therefore  be prudent to watch out for fundamentally sound restaurant stocks that can make the most of the bullish scenario  We have  thus  highlighted four such stocks that have the propensity to grow in the near term  These

15 9  Chipotle Mexican Grill  Inc    NYSE CMG    together with its subsidiaries  operates Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants  Chipotle stock almost doubled last year and it may still have more room to run this year  The company s initiative to constantly innovate its menu will surely drive sales Last year  the fast casual chain s  Lifestyle  bowls was quite favored by customers  Chipotle is now poised to relaunch such bowls in the form of new salad blends  including baby kale and baby spinach Jack Bartlett  an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey  in the meantime said that as a result of

107,221622,UBER,Stocks Roar Back From The Abyss On A Manic Wednesday,opinion,"Well  that was fun  From panic to euphoria in less than 24 hours  A little manic  Perhaps 

Ok  maybe it wasn t euphoric yesterday  but surely it wasn t anywhere close to what the futures were indicating last night  Maybe the ADP Jobs report helped a bit there  I think the report paints a positive picture for Friday s BLS job report  
Additionally  President Trump s announcement on Iran surely helped to calm fears too  
S P 500  SPY 
It is kind of amazing that the S P 500 Futures touched 3 180 Tuesday night at 7 30 PM  only to reach 3 267 by 3 15 PM yesterday  That s only a 2 65  reversal off the lows  






The goods news here is the futures took out resistance at 3 253  and the previous highs around 3 260  It does suggest that the S P 500 continues higher 







Additionally  the pattern in the cash market would also suggest that higher prices are coming  despite not officially breaking out yesterday  It seems to me based on the chart that a flag pattern has formed  and it suggests higher stock prices lay ahead for the index  if not today  then Friday  
Energy  XLE One has to wonder what has happened to the energy sector  If it can t rally on rising oil prices  then what is going to be a catalyst for the group  It is worth noting that the XLE  NYSE XLE  ETF is trading at levels not seen since the year 2000 relative to the SPY  NYSE SPY   It is nearly at its lowest point ever  It is trading as if it is a dying asset class  perhaps it is 






Tesla  TSLA 
Anyway  if you want a mind blogging chart  Look at this one of Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  relative to the S P 500 ETF  What is interesting here is that Tesla isn t even at its highest levels relative to the S P 500  which was in June 2017  It is almost as if the stock is trying to play a giant game of catch up for all those years of underperformance 







The stock got as high as  498 yesterday  and pretty close to the  508 technical target I laid out over the weekend 






Square  SQ Square  NYSE SQ  continues to rip higher  and those options traders have to be feeling good about themselves at this point  It looks like  70 is the next level potentially for the stock 






Roku  ROKU  
Well   Roku   NASDAQ ROKU  seems to be going according to plan this week  that s good  It probably means the stock goes to  127 






Uber  UBER Uber  NYSE UBER  is finally starting to come back to life  rising above  33 15  and now it may be on its way to  35 90  It looks like the falling wedge pattern is now in full effect 






Netflix  NFLX 
Should we talk about Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   Ok  fine  I mentioned it yesterday in the mid day update  noting the stock was challenging resistance at  336  It finally broke out and climbed above resistance to around  339  The RSI and the push above resistance make me think the stock can now work to fill that gap up to  362  How many times have I said that before ",2020-01-09,Michael Kramer,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-roar-back-from-the-abyss-on-a-manic-wednesday-200497448,200497448
108,221623,UBER,AmEx Opens Two Lounges To Offer Premium Amenities To Members,opinion,"American Express Co    NYSE AXP   and MAG USA announced the opening of The Centurion Lounge and Escape Lounge at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport  PHX   These lounges will be accessible to Platinum Card and Centurion members 
With more than 44 million passengers passing through this airport each year  the opening of these lounges provides American Express with a unique opportunity to offer world class lounge amenities  which would help it to retain existing members and get new ones 
American Express has a network of Centurion Lounges at major airports to cater to their Platinum and Centurion card holders   The company has been constantly modifying benefits and rewards in its various card categories to provide premium services to its members  In the third quarter  it continued to refresh its Platinum Card portfolio across several international markets 
The company is also revising its Gold Cards and iconic Green Card  It also improved its Corporate Card program  which includes a number of new features like enhanced benefits with Uber  NYSE UBER   Hilton  and CLEAR 
These initiatives are likely to drive the company s growth and boost spending and engagement on its refreshed products  Higher member engagement is also leading to growth of loans disbursed by the company  Over 60  of the total loan growth is coming from existing card members and enabling it to earn a steady stream of revenues 
Also  the company has been able to add new card members through its existing customers via  Member Get Member referral program  This program has helped it to acquire more than 250 000 new customers in the first nine months of 2019  Moreover  successful referrals have increased 35  compared with the third quarter of 2018 
American Express has been witnessing an increase in the adoption of fee based products  which reflects the fancy of its customers for luxury services  Both Platinum and Centurion cards carry annual fees 
Nevertheless  the provision of these services and rewards to its members will increase the company s customer engagement cost  card member services cost and rewards expenses 
The company expects this to be its fastest growing expense category as it includes the cost of many components of its differentiated value propositions such as airport lounge access and other travel benefits 
These services are difficult for other companies to replicate and support the engagement American Express is seeing on its fee based products American Express is the fourth largest general purpose card network on a global basis based on purchase volume  behind China UnionPay  Visa Inc    NYSE V   and MasterCard Inc    NYSE MA    It is the fourth largest card network in the world  based on the number of cards it has in circulation 
The stock has gained 26 4  compared with its  s growth of 16 5  over the past year  American Express carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  

 
Another company worth considering is AXA Equitable Holdings  Inc    NYSE EQH    which also carries a Zacks Rank  2  AXA Equitable surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters  the surprise being 12 4   on average You can see

109,221624,UBER,Top Research Reports For Bank Of America  Wells Fargo   Toyota Motor,opinion,"Wednesday  January 8  2020
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Bank of America  BAC   Wells Fargo  WFC  and Toyota Motor  TM   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Bank of America s shares have outperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry over the past year   34 4  vs   27 2    The Zacks analyst believes that opening branches in new regions  improved digital offerings  decent loan growth and efforts to control costs will aid profitability despite the Fed s accommodative monetary policy stance 
Further  efforts to focus more on consumer banking business have started bearing fruits  The company s enhanced capital deployment actions reflect a strong balance sheet position  However  dismal performance of capital markets continues to hurt the company s investment banking and trading businesses  which in turn will hamper fee income growth  Moreover  earnings estimates have been moving lower ahead of its fourth quarter 2019 results 
 You can  
Shares of Wells Fargo have gained  9 4  in the past three months against the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry s rise of  17 7   The Zacks analyst believes that though the company s investment in the businesses to enhance compliance and risk management capability seems impressive  Wells Fargo has been slapped with several sanctions  which continues on the CFPB s dissatisfaction with the bank s progress on fixing risk management issues 
Earnings estimates have been revised upward ahead of the company s fourth quarter results  Also  the company s earnings surprise history remains impressive  having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters 
Strategic acquisitions along with rising loans and deposit balances are impressive  Also  rising costs curb bottom line expansion  Moreover  lower NII remain a concern 
 You can  
Toyota Motor s shares have gained  11 5  over the past six months against the Zacks Foreign Automotive industry s rise of  9 4   The Zacks analyst believes that expanding portfolio of product lines is driving the firm s sales 
In order to capitalize on the accelerated global shift to electric cars  the auto giant of Japan is deepening focus on developing electric and autonomous vehicles  which will bolster the company s product competitiveness  Its healthy balance sheet  improving cash flows and investor friendly moves are other positives 
However  anticipating a slowdown in India  Indonesia and Thailand  the company narrowed its annual vehicle sales target for fiscal 2020  High research and development expenses on advanced technologies for the development of EVs and driverless cars are also likely to dent near term margins  As such  investors are recommended to wait for a better entry point

110,221625,UBER,Tempur Sealy  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  Spotify  Apple And Amazon Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 9  2020    Shares of Tempur Sealy   NYSE TPX   as the Bull of the Day  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N V    NYSE FCAU   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Spotify   NYSE SPOT    Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   and Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Tempur Sealy s shares have soared over 80  during the last year to crush its industry s average and the S P 500  The mattress powerhouse returned to sales growth in 2018 and its expansion looks poised to continue as it proves it s ready to fight off challenges from digital upstarts through its own direct to consumer expansion and more The PitchTempur Sealy is one of the world s largest bedding companies that offers everything from mattresses to pillows  under different brands  which include Tempur  Tempur Pedic  Sealy  Cocoon by Sealy  and Stearns   Foster  The company  which makes over 80  of its revenue in North America  has ramped up its digital and direct to consumer business in the Amazon age to help better compete against online based newcomers such as Casper Tempur Sealy topped our Q3 earnings and revenues estimates  with adjusted earnings up 28  and sales up 12 5   Both TPX s top and bottom line expansions marked the sixth consecutive quarter of growth for the firm  after it saw a downturn between the second quarter of 2017 and Q1 2018 More specifically  direct channel sales soared 62  to account for roughly 14  of quarterly revenue  up from around 9  during the third quarter of 2018  This strength helped TPX s gross margin come in at 43 9   up from 41 1    In fact  during the third quarter we recognized the highest gross profit in the company s history  greater than what was generated previously across a larger presence   CEO Scott Thompson said in prepared Q3 remarks  Our double digit growth in operating income and adjusted EBITDA allows us to continue investing in our plants  products and people  while repurchasing our stock and strengthening our balance sheet by reducing our financial leverage  Investors should note that Tempur Sealy recently began new partnerships with Big Lots  NYSE BIG  and Mattress Firm  The company also opened its 50th Tempur Pedic retail store in Q3 and management reaffirmed that it could open as many as 150 in the long run And one of the firm s newer offerings  the TEMPUR LUXEbreeze  recently landed on Popular Science s  awards list in 2019  The offering helps create a cooler sleeping surface  which could be a hit since the firm claims that  sleeping hot is the number one unmet consumer challenge in the sleep industry    with more than 60  of Americans struggling with this problem  Other Fundamentals TPX stock is up 82  in the past year to destroy its Retail Home Furnishings Market s 24  average climb  This group includes the likes of RH  Ethan Allen and others TPX shares are also up 15  in the last three months  but have cooled off recently  which could give the stock some room to run  TPX stock closed regular trading Wednesday at roughly  85 per share  This came in around 8  below its 52 week intraday highs of over  92 Tempur Sealy s valuation has become a little stretched on the back of its climb  Still  TPX stock is trading below its three year highs in terms of forward 12 months sales and earnings  In fact  TPX is trading at 15 1X forward earnings  which matches its three year median and marks a discount against its 52 week median of 16 2X TPX currently holds  B  grades for both Value and Growth in our Style Scores system and rests in the top 9  of our more than 250 Zacks industries  The firm has also returned value to shareholders through buybacks Outlook Looking ahead  our current Zacks estimates call for Tempur Sealy s fourth quarter sales to jump 14   with Q1 2020 projected to surge 17 2   These would both top Q3 s 12 5  sales expansion The company s full year fiscal 2019 sales are projected to pop 11 5  to hit  3 01 billion  Better still  TPX s fiscal 2020 revenues are expected to climb 16  above our current year estimate to reach  3 49 billion  Both of these figures would crush 2018 s marginal top line expansion and mark the company s strongest sales growth since 2014 On the bottom end of the income statement  Tempur Sealy s adjusted Q4 earnings are projected to climb over 31  to  1 18 per share  with Q1 2020 set to soar 63  higher  Meanwhile  its full year EPS figure is expected to soar 28 4   And 2020 s earnings are then projected to surge another 46  to  5 55 a share Bottom LineTempur Sealy has topped our quarterly earnings estimates by roughly 15  in the trailing three periods  Plus  its 2019 and 2020 earnings outlook has climbed significantly since it reported its Q3 results in late October Overall  TPX s recent positive earnings revision trends help it earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  standing  The company s ability to successfully adapt to the direct to consumer age appears ready to help Tempur Sealy continue to thrive in a business segment that won t ever go out of style Tempur Pedic landed at No  1 in terms of customer satisfaction for the retail mattress segment in the J D  Power 2019 Mattress Satisfaction Report  And consumers are clearly willing to pay for quality when it comes to where they rest their heads at night  This means that investors might not want to sleep on Tempur Sealy stock  Shares of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N V  have fallen 35  in the past two years and its planned merger with Peugeot maker Groupe PSA still awaits regulatory approval  The auto giant s sales have also slumped over the trailing 12 months and earnings are projected to slip as the auto industry races to spend on the next generation of technology What s Going On Fiat Chrysler and PSA officially announced their finalized merger terms on December 18  The deal would create the world s third largest auto maker and house Jeep  Ram  Fiat  Peugeot  and more  The merger is designed to help the joint firm better compete globally and adapt to an industry  from Ford to Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA   that has started to invest heavily in electric and autonomous driving The merger must still be approved in both the U S  and Europe  Executives from the two automotive giants expect the process to take between 12 and 15 months Along with the lengthy and uncertain process ahead  investors should note that auto sales face challenges in China and elsewhere amid a slowing global economy  For example  GM recently posted its  and warned that 2020 could be rough as well Plus  U S  light duty vehicle sales slipped 1 6  in 2019   Edmunds  Meanwhile  the likes of Uber  NYSE UBER  and other ride hailing firms have disrupted the industry In terms of Fiat Chrysler  the company s sales have slipped roughly 9  in the trailing 12 months  FCAU stock is also down roughly 10  during this same stretch  which lags its broader industry s 11  climb and the S P 500 s 24  jump Other Fundamentals  Fiat Chrysler s valuation is solid at the moment as it trades at a discount against its industry s average  5 1X vs  8 7X   However  the stock has traded as low as 4 3X forward 12 month Zacks earnings estimates over the last year FCAU s Automotive   Foreign industry currently rests in the bottom 40  of our more than 250 Zacks industries  FCAU stock is also trading below its 50 day moving average  Plus  our estimates call for the firm s full year earnings to fall nearly 23  this year and another 5 2  next year   Bottom LineFiat Chrysler is currently a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  based on its recent negative earnings revision trends  With that said  interested investors might want to keep an eye on the firm as it tries to complete its PSA merger Additional content Time to Take a Second Look at the Music Streaming KingSpotify has not performed as well as initial investors expected since its direct listing in April of 2018  but it s on its way up  SPOT has gained 24  since its strong Q3 earnings at the end of October  and I think this rally has legs  The stock is trading at the lower end of its forward P S trend and below the broader market  I believe now is an excellent time to put a long term position on the music streaming king Podcast OfferingSpotify s big bet on podcast looks like it is beginning to pay off  with 39  quarter over quarter growth in podcast hours streamed  This exponential growth in podcast engagement will continue to drive more conversions from ad supported users to full paying subscribers The music streaming leader has been building out its podcast offering this year with three key acquisitions  to rival the podcast king  Apple  Spotify purchased Gimlet  Anchor  and Parcast in the first half of 2019 for roughly  400 million  These acquisitions not only broaden Spotify s library of podcasts  but it also enables them to improve their original content and enables users to produce and circulate their own podcasts  Taking control of the podcast market would be a big win for Spotify as this market is expecting to be a billion dollar global ad market in the next couple of years Competitive Advantage As of Spotify s September quarter  it has 248 million active monthly users  MAUs  and 113 million paying subscribers globally  Paying subscribers bring in substantially larger margins than ad supported users  The strategy is to initially get customers to try their platform free as an ad supported customer  then provide the user with a product offering that drives enough engagement for the customer to see the value in purchasing the premium subscription  Spotify has been increasing its MAUs by around 30  for the past couple of years while paying subscribers make up a growing percentage of total users  The dive into podcasts should advance both metrics Competition in the music streaming space is steep  but Spotify s seemingly superior product offering continues to expand its market share  The platform currently adds nearly twice as many paying subscribers every month as its biggest competitor  Apple  according to Spotify s most recent financial report  It also drives twice as much engagement at half the churn rate  user loss   Spotify is outpacing Amazon music as well  which has a user base that is skewed towards ad supported users Investor s biggest concern about SPOT is the fact that its competition is just transitioning to service based business models and will do whatever it takes to control the spaces they are entering  Apple and Amazon both have ostensibly limitless resources  Investors wonder how a pure play streaming service like Spotify can remain competitive Spotify not only has a massive consumer base already  but the company drives a cultural trend for millennials and Gen Z s  I don t see them deviating from this movement anytime soon  Competitors will need to take a substantial amount of market share to become leaders in the music streaming space  and at Spotify s current customer acquisition rate  that doesn t seem possible  FinancialsSpotify is a Swedish company that has gained enormous international traction  now operating in 79 markets  The company has a healthy balance sheet with over  2 1 billion in cash and a debt to capital of less than 25   The company has been able to support growing positive free cash flows that will continue to provide Spotify with financial flexibility to expand its business organically and through acquisitions Take Away SPOT is trading 4  above where it closed its first day on the market and 24  below its all time high  I am confident that this stock can bounce back as the digitalizing world drives more music lovers to this platform  Spotify is a leader in a growing space and continues to gain market share  Sell side analysts are growing more confident about this stock after the latest earnings and are projecting an average target price that would represent an over 10  upside Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity  Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices  In the process  it s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate  12 3 trillion in activity A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech  Early investors could see gains similar to buying

124,221639,UBER,Is This The Top ,opinion,"Parabolic moves end when the confidence that the parabolic move can t end becomes the consensus 

The consensus seems to be that the stock market is on its way to much higher levels  and soon  The near term targets for the S P 500  SPX  currently around 3 235  range from 3 500 to 4 000  with longer term targets reaching  the sky s the limit  
The consensus reasoning goes like this 
   Central banks can print a lot more money
   Stocks rise when central banks print more money 
The history of the 2009 2019 era strongly supports this simple cause effect  and so just about everyone is on the same side of the boat  the  don t fight the Fed  side of ever higher stock multiples and ever higher prices 
Simply put  sales and profits no longer matter  the only thing that matters is whether central banks are printing more money  And since we all know they ll have to print more money to keep the flying pig  the stock market  aloft  then it follows as night follows day that stocks will rise essentially forever 
As soon as the consensus has settled complacently on one side of the boat  contrarians take notice as history has a perverse habit of foiling any overwhelmingly complacent consensus 

The contrarian asks  what if this is  The Top   Not just the top of the current rally  but The Top of the Bull Market that ignited in March 2009  Impossible  say the Bulls  there s cash on the sidelines  UBER LYFT drivers aren t yet touting obscure stocks  i e   everybody  is not yet in the market  central banks haven t even warmed up their digital printing presses  corporations are flush with cash credit to continue their decade long gorging on stock buy backs and the global economy is back on track for another decade or three of tepid  growth  

Maybe this is all true  maybe not  Maybe Uber Lyft drivers are too broke to care about the stock market  Maybe  cash on the sidelines  isn t interested in gambling in the equity bubble casino  Maybe corporate credit dries up  Maybe stock buy backs are no longer sufficient to push stocks higher by 30  to 100  every year  Maybe there are limits on the effectiveness of central bank stimulus  Maybe the false dawn of global growth is fading 

Maybe diminishing returns  including but not limited to diminishing marginal returns  are setting in and all these bullish dynamics are running on fumes 

As a case study  let s look at two charts of Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   operating income and its stock price  Interestingly  operating income has been stagnant to down for years  while the stock price has gone parabolic 







History has recorded many parabolic moves like this  and they all end badly 







Yet the consensus faithful continue to believe that there are only two scenarios to choose from 
1  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  stock has reached a  permanently high plateau  around  300
2  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  stock will continue doubling   75 to  150   150 to  300   300 to  600 

All previous parabolic moves reversed in roughly symmetric fashion  returning to their starting base  or lower   So the consensus is claiming that  ahem  this time it s different  Maybe  maybe not 

These parabolic ascents are characterized by 1  increasing amplitude and 2  time compression  each ascent leaps higher and in less time than previous moves  Why  The consensus is so strong that everyone starts front running the next ascent  This front running accelerates as everyone tries to front run the front runners 

Parabolic moves end when the confidence that the parabolic move can t end becomes the consensus  Nobody believes this could be The Top because the confidence that every future ascent can be front run is so high 

Another way to understand this dynamic is that beneath the surface stability  buffers have eroded and are now paper thin  I covered how this works in How Systems Collapse  May 29  2018  







As I explain in my recent book Will You Be Richer or Poorer  Profit  Power and A I  in a Traumatized World  we don t look at systemic buffers  much less measure them  and so the precariousness of parabolic moves is invisible to the consensus 

Every central bank  save  and every tsunami of stimulus has eroded systemic buffers  Now that everyone is counting on the current tidal wave of stimulus to lift all boats  the buffers will give way in a disorderly systemic destabilization 

If you want to wait for the Uber Lyft driver to share a hot stock tip to signal the top  be my guest  But you might want to look at WeWork s collapse as an alternative signal that The Top Is In  While financial pundits are cheering the next ascent to SPX 4 000  nobody seems to have noticed that most of America is over indebted and broke 
But never mind that  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   600 and SPX 6 000 guaranteed  hum baby ",2020-01-06,Charles Hugh Smith,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-this-the-top-200496482,200496482

126,221641,UBER,Outlook 2020  Small Caps  Growth Stocks  Swing Traders Could All Gain,opinion,"By Caroline Gerber
Risk on investor sentiment has propelled markets to new records as 2019 comes to a close  In the last few weeks of the year  U S  equities rallied to all time highs with the S P 500 up about 28 5  ahead of the final day of trade  fueled  in part  by the Fed s decision to cut interest rates three times this year  the most cuts per year since the 2008 financial crisis  

Adding to the positive attitude  recent major geopolitical risks have cooled  The U S  China trade dispute  which has kept investors on edge since mid 2018 and cost global economy roughly  700 billion USD according to the IMF  could see a Phase One agreement signed in January  This alone boosted investor confidence  and global and U S  markets  in December  
Brexit  the other political stalemate worrying investors  is also heading toward some sort of decisive resolution after the UK s Dec  12 general election was won resoundingly by Prime Minister Boris Johnson  That victory shifted the political map  empowering the PM to leave the EU even if the inevitable struggle of  getting Brexit done  ends up being a hard exit 

While optimism powered equities  persistent global economic uncertainties have helped lift gold  The safe haven precious metal is up about 16 31  with just one trading day left in 2019  Trade war risks  stagnating growth in Europe and Japan and political unrest in Hong Kong and Latin America continue to be market hazards  

On the domestic front  many of 2019 s highly anticipated unicorn IPOs  including Uber  NYSE UBER   LYFT  NASDAQ LYFT  and Slack  NYSE WORK   left investors seriously underwhelmed   Another heralded debut  WeWork  collapsed entirely before even making it to the starting gate 
For all the sound and fury surrounding the resurgence of initial public offerings  however  it was Saudi Aramco s  SE 2222  tender  on Riyadh s Tadawul exchange  that eclipsed them all  proving to be the largest IPO in history  raising 25 6 billion which gave the oil producer a valuation of  1 7 trillion   Since Aramco shares reached a high of  38 on Dec  16  they have dropped 7 63  to the current price of  35 1   

To kick off 2020   we turned to some of our most popular contributors for insight into where they see markets heading in the coming year  In this part 1 of our two part series  three contributors weigh in on where they think equities will be heading next year  Tomorrow  New Year s Day  we ll publish contributor analysis focused on commodities  forex and the general market outlook  Read it here  
Declan Fallon  New Breakout Following Cyclical Bear Recovery
Most of 2019 was spent making back the losses from the latter part of 2018 with the S P and NASDAQ waiting until October to finally provide the rally that delivered new all time highs for this year  The Russell 2000 still has some ground to make up  with the 2018 high around 1 740 remaining some distance away  







So while some may talk of big gains delivered from the start of the year for indices  what we are really looking at is a new breakout following a cyclical bear recovery   When framed like this  the true winner for 2020 could be growth stocks 
The Russell 2000  via iShares Russell 2000 ETF  NYSE IWM   is primed to challenge the 2018 high with a mini breakout from this year s consolidation  This is a very healthy looking chart  







Adding fuel to the rally is an election year that Trump will be keen to pump 
The Semiconductor sector has done well for 2019  Like the rail companies of old  it is a bellwether for the economy  so if it is booming  businesses are expanding and updating their technology requirements  While the pace of this rally may slow for 2020  the tone has been set for the year  






Bitcoin traders may have to wait until the summer before they see some joy to the upside  The 200 day MA was the bounce point from early in the year and 4 500s was a resistance level in 2017  so it may turn into support for 2020  Bitcoin is to Millenials as Gold is to Boomers  it will have its day again  






Michele Schneider  Watch Growth Signals From Russell  Retail  Transports
Considering the December rally in the indices  and particularly the S P 500  NASDAQ 100 and the Dow  two possible scenarios emerge for 2020 

Either the market is forward thinking and assumes the economy will begin to expand in 2020  Or  by keeping interest rates near zero or in some cases negative  the Federal Reserve and global central banks have incentivized corporations to continue their record share buybacks for the upcoming year 
To date  corporations have done little to expand development or hiring  Instead  they have mainly raised dividends to reward shareholders as well as invested in their own stocks  That will have to change to keep up with the tight job market 

To tell if the U S  economy is indeed expanding  investors should watch the domestically focused Russell 2000 along with two key sectors 

The Russell 2000  IWM  is the best representative of the U S  economy  It s composed of small cap companies that manufacture or produce goods in the U S  To date  IWM has begun to move out of a base  but it s still well off the all time highs made in 2018  We can consider IWM as the  supply  side of economics  

Transportation  NYSE IYT  has also lagged the SPX  via the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY   the NASDAQ  via Invesco QQQ Trust  NASDAQ QQQ  and the Dow  via SPDR  Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust  NYSE DIA    With the recent dismal performance of FedEx  NYSE FDX   transportation  or the  demand  side of economics has a major job to do to prove goods are robustly moving throughout the country  IYT must hold over 188 00 and eventually clear 200 00 

Bricks and mortar Retail  NYSE XRT  has been the biggest laggard with retail sales weak  This sector has been the ugly duckling  reflecting high consumer debt likely to increase further during the holiday season  Therefore  XRT must hold above 44 00 and clear 47 00 or the 2019 highs 

Regardless of what the key index and sectors do  geopolitically 2020 is likely to become more volatile  That makes stagflation another real possibility 
In 2019  the ratio between stocks and commodities hit a 100 year low  As we end 2019  the ratio has contracted some but can shrink much more in 2020  Since 1979  inflation has remained muted  Given statements by Steven Kaplan  the President of the Dallas Reserve  that interest rates will remain low and the future of the dollar as the world s reserve currency is questionable  the best trades for 2020 could be in commodities  There will be more on this tomorrow 

To summarize  investors need to watch the small caps  transportation and bricks and mortar retail sectors for signs of economic growth or stagnation  With low interest rates  an uncertain future for the dollar and rising geopolitical volatility  inflation should increase with the possibility of an emerging stagflation environment 
Jani Ziedins  No 2019 Repeat  But 2020 Could Be Great For Opportunistic Swing Traders
2019 was the year of a generous and gentle rally  The S P 500 climbed nearly 30  and most pullbacks were benign  with prices recovering quickly  This strength was definitely aided by a snapback from 2018 s grossly oversold 4th quarter  Regardless of the source  this looks to be the market s second strongest annual performance since the dot com bubble 







While crashes are scary and forever seared into the memory of anyone who lives through one  they are exceedingly rare  Most active traders will only see one or two in their careers  Will next year be one of those years  Probably not  Especially since the market is not grossly overbought or overleveraged like it was during the dot com and housing bubbles  Stocks are definitely not cheap  but they are not  bubblelicious  either 
Unfortunately for us  2020 will look nothing like 2019 as the market almost never repeats a performance and next year won t be any different  If we a cross the prospect of a strong rally off the list of possibilities  we re left with three potential scenarios  modest rally  slight dip or stock market crash 

Crossing both extremes off the list leaves us with a little up or a little down  At this point  I could see either happening  The labor market is stretched and labor shortages will keep a lid on economic growth going forward  If a business cannot find new staff  it cannot expand no matter how strong demand is 
On the other side  modest stock market gains could easily be wiped out if an unpopular Republican president is replaced by a Democrat  Fear of looming regulations and taxes will send stocks retreating in the final months of 2020  And so  that is my prediction  fairly modest gains between 5  and 10  if Trump wins  If he loses  expect a flat year 

But where we end is only one piece of the puzzle  How we get there is even more important to active traders 
Everyone knows stocks cannot sit still and like a sugared up 5 year old  they always have to be moving  Sometimes they move up for extended periods like they did in 2019  Other times they decline relentlessly as happened in 2008  But most of the time  they move up and down for no other reason than they cannot sit still  2020 will be a year of moving just because  which means lots of moderate dips and bounces along the way 
While it won t show up in a long term portfolio  2020 will be a great year for the opportunistic swing trader

The net result is that the global economy is on a moderate footing now  Though there are no recessionary fears right now  slowdown concerns can t be ruled out  Still  we do believe that 2020 should be a year for stocks as dovish central banks amid slowing global economy will keep pumping cheap money into the economies  Trade tensions have eased considerably from the fourth quarter of this year  However  as markets have rallied ahead of the phase one trade deal in early 2020  the real news may not boost markets as much as expected

130,221645,UBER,As California s AB5 Becomes Law  Uber s Path to Profitability Just Got More Complicated,news,"Uber Technologies  NYSE UBER  was one of the most anticipated IPOs of last year  Many investors felt that the company s strong position in the ride hailing industry would turn into meaningful returns on the stock market  However  things haven t gone that way  at least not yet  At writing  Uber s stock is down by 18  from its  45 IPO price  One reason behind this lackluster performance has been the red ink on Uber s bottom line 
Although few people expected the ridesharing giant to turn a profit in its first year as a publicly traded company  the pace at which Uber has been losing money is dizzying  During the third quarter  Uber s net loss was  1 2 billion  and that was significantly better than the company s  5 2 billion net loss recorded during the second quarter  Unfortunately for Uber  a new California law dubbed AB5 makes it harder for the company to classify its drivers as independent contractors  and its road to profitability isn t getting any easier 

What AB5 is all about
Gig workers    i e   independent contractors like Uber drivers    aren t entitled to receive many of the benefits full time employees enjoy  These benefits include paid time off  sick days  a minimum wage  and unemployment insurance  among others  However  California s AB5  which was signed into law last September and took effect Jan  1  makes it harder for Uber to classify its drivers as independent contractors  AB5 outlines three conditions that companies must meet to classify those working for them as independent contractors 

The worker must be free from the direct control of the company 
The worker must perform tasks that are outside the company s core business 
The worker must be  engaged in an independently established trade  occupation  or business of the same nature as that involved in the work performed   

Uber  as well as its rival Lyft  NASDAQ LYFT  and other companies in the gig economy such as GrubHub  NYSE GRUB   have vehemently opposed this law  After all  for Uber  having to reclassify its drivers as fully fledged employees would mean these drivers are entitled to the benefits being an employee typically comes with  Providing such benefits to thousands of contractors turned employees would drastically increase Uber s expenses  
Profitability is nowhere in sight for Uber
During Uber s third quarter earnings conference call  CEO Dara Khosrowshahi announced the company s plans to become profitable by 2021  However  that comes with a major caveat  Khosrowshahi was only referring to Uber s earnings before taxes  expenses  depreciation  and amortization  EBITDA  being in the green  The company has no timeline  that we know of  for when it will record a net profit 
And with AB5 taking effect  the company s expenses will likely rise  which could make it even more difficult for Uber to become profitable  Note that other states  such as New York  New York City is Uber s largest ridesharing market   have been exploring the possibility of enacting similar laws  New York City even imposed some restrictions on the company  including a minimum driver wage  In other words  the regulatory landscape isn t getting any easier for Uber  and that may well affect the company s ability to become profitable 
Will Uber turn things around 
Despite all the problems Uber is facing  some may argue that given its leading position in the ride hailing market    as well as its food delivery app Uber Eats    the company could well turn things around  However  Uber is losing money at a fast clip  and given the worsening regulatory conditions  Uber likely won t be consistently profitable anytime soon  For those reasons  I think it s best to stay on the sidelines for now  especially as there are plenty of exciting growth stocks to consider buying ",2020-01-14,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phyyn,2059242
131,221646,UBER,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Amazon  Microsoft  Apple  Netflix And Facebook,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 30  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT    Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX   and Facebook   NASDAQ FB   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  This Decade in TechA decade is a long time by any standards  but in technology  a decade is a lifetime  And in the last one  technology became a more fluid thing  filling gaps we never perceived existed  bringing people closer together like never before  making life much easier and permeating into areas where we didn t always want it For enterprises  this meant a bring your own device  BYOD  trend  melting away the distinction between consumer and enterprise usage that had until then been so important to maintain  This coupled with an entire revolution in mobile computing with tablets  hybrids and whatnot meant that employees could carry their devices practically anywhere  or even work from home All this is  of course  facilitated by the cloud  which  mostly through Amazon s AWS  but increasingly also Microsoft s Azure and to a lesser extent  Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  Cloud   faithfully maintains the computing resources  programs and data generated  so companies have the option to scale as required while spending only to the extent of resources consumed  and employees enjoy greater flexibility and speed to achieve more desirable outcomes  Scores of companies providing specialized services have jumped on top of this infrastructure so everyone can do more for less Behind it all is another revolution in miniaturization and concentration of computer power  with integrated circuits getting even smaller and phones acquiring larger screens and becoming mini computers  housing every bit of information we could possibly need through the day  This  of course  increased anxiety about data theft that technology companies assuaged with biometric unlocking  including fingerprints  and most recently  facial recognition technology The app world saw sea changes  with some members like Amazon  Apple Music  Netflix and a few others pulling significantly ahead  The digitization of entertainment happened with Chromecast  Roku  Apple TV  Netflix  etc   but many others are joining in as cord cutting has become an undeniable reality  With greater usage came greater variety in payment options and even more apps gained popularity  Digital currencies and blockchain technology hold promise for the future Facebook  disappearing messages from Instagram  before it was acquired by Facebook  and more recently  Tiktok has changed the way we communicate today  although Facebook s impact has perhaps been the most significant  And Twitter has become the go to place for breaking news when it isn t busy documenting celebrity gaffes While we had new iterations of Microsoft s Xbox  Sony s PS and the Nintendo Switch  gaming was really redefined with e sports as a new category  drawing millions of viewers and attracting significant ad dollars  Enhancing all that was new visual technology in the form of augmented and virtual realities Glasses overall progressed but weren t smashing hits as Google s version ran into privacy and other issues  Facebook s Oculus proved too expensive and Microsoft s HoloLens saw limited use  Still  companies and geeks remain interested in the possibilities as AR matured and made its way into iPhones Somewhere along the line  we realized that it would be fun to have our infotainment in our cars  so Apple s Carplay and Alphabet s Android Auto were born We re also more willing to share resources today because we ve discovered their scarcity and our ability to get by with less  So Uber  NYSE UBER   Lyft  NASDAQ LYFT  etc  have captured our imagination With people warming to ecommerce and home delivery  there are many companies willing to do the job for a nominal fee  And some have taken this a step further with drones  Regulation is playing catch up  but the tech that can carry a few pounds worth of goods to a certain destination without human intervention is available and ready to go On a more personal level  voice commands have become easier with personal assistants and digital home devices  although some people are tiring of automation devices crowding the home  But we re still interested in smart devices around our wrists  and these are getting more capable  Telling your watch to get things done is neither sci fi nor even a novelty any more  as the tech is going mainstream With all that data running between devices and clouds  there has  of course  also been a revolution in telecom networks  4G LTE has increased speeds that 5G will take much further  And software defined networking has lowered networking costs for enterprises Data mining  machine learning and artificial intelligence have been a natural follow on  and it s clear that tomorrow s leaders are those that have the most data today Oh  and did I forget All these things came at a cost  Security issues  data breaches  identity theft and privacy issues have become household items  The next decade may not solve these issues  but the number of lawsuits piling up indicates that there will be better definition of responsibilities Will everything be perfect in the future  I doubt it  But one thing I m sure of is that we ll make more progress Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming

133,221648,UBER,For Most U S  Major Indices 2019 Has Been Great  Can That Continue In 2020 ,opinion,"When trading opened in 2019  investors were just hoping stocks would produce a rebound from the awful fourth quarter in 2018  But Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  nearly spoiled everything 
Shares fell more than 32  between an all time high in September 2018 and year end  It fell another 10  on Jan  3 after announcing its fiscal first quarter results would be weak  dragging the entire stock market down with it 
Then  Apple and the U S  stock market overall rebounded  often fitfully and  in the fourth quarter  powerfully  With just two trading days left in 2019  the S P 500  currently up 29 25   looks poised for its best year since 2013 and possibly 1997 

The Dow Jones Industrials are up 22 8   The NASDAQ  and NASDAQ 100 indexes could all see their best years since 2009 
Equities Remained Steady Vs  Headwinds  Tech Shares Provided Spark
Stocks this past year have weathered volatility caused by a variety of headwinds  tweets from President Donald Trump about the U S  China trade war  the Federal Reserve  the Mueller probe and possible impeachment  rising oil prices are up by a third from a year ago  concerns about how Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and other big tech companies deal with privacy issues and political advertising  and the grounding of Boeing s  NYSE BA  737 MAX after two crashes  in Indonesia and Ethiopia  killed 346 people 
2020 could be strong as well  There will be challenges  such as whether big money thinks sky high stock prices are an issue 
The catalysts for the 2019 rebound were clearly technology shares 

Apple  Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD   NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   Facebook  Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  are all up more than 50   The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up nearly 61  
Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  and Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  look like slackers  up  only  30  and 24   respectively 
Several factors outside technology combined to produce these boffo gains  

The reduction of U S  China trade tensions with a possible phase one trade deal set to be signed in January  China is a huge export market for farm products and computer chips  That is no guarantee all the other and more complicated issues will be resolved 
Lower interest rates after the Federal Reserve realized the trade battles were hurting economies around the globe as well as U S  exports   The cynic might argue the Fed got tired of Trump s tweets   Still  the 10 year yield finished Friday at 1 87   off 30  from the end of 2018  Real Estate and utilities stocks are up more than 20  
A decent domestic economy with consumer spending steady to strong  Hence strong results and rising stock prices for the likes of  Home Depot   NYSE HD   Lowe s  NYSE LOW   McDonald s  NYSE MCD  and Sherwin Williams  NYSE SHW   Investors see Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   up 37   weathering the competitive storm created by   Disney   NYSE DIS   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and others 

Accompanying the tech boom was an impressive rally in financial stocks  The Financial Select Sector SPDR  ETF  NYSE XLF  is up 29  this year  It finally recovered all the losses it suffered during the 2008 2009 financial crisis and jumped above its old record peak set in 2007 
JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM   the largest U S  bank by assets  is up 42   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  is up 38  
Still  There Were Laggards
There have been some losers  Boeing  up just 2 4   had been up as much as 38  on March 2  just before the 737 MAX crisis hit  Though the CEO has been sacked  there s still no timetable on when the plane s problems will be fixed and the plane recertified  United Airlines  NASDAQ UAL  has pulled the plane from its schedule until at least June 4 

Pharmacy giant Walgreen Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA   was the weakest Dow stock this past year and the third worst performer among NASDAQ 100 stocks  The company is currently looking for ways to go private 
Traditional retailers have struggled  pressured by the might of online behemoth Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Macy s  NYSE M  is off nearly 45   Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  is down more than 12   but enjoying a 21  fourth quarter rebound   Target   NYSE TGT   however  is up 96   the fourth best among S P 500 stocks 
The conventional wisdom is that 2020 could be a good year  although forecasts are usually  well  wrong  Still  the three major factors lower trade tensions  lower interest rates  a stable domestic economy will remain in place after Dec  31  That s a good sign  but U S  stocks will start 2020 with some headwinds 
First  2019 opened with the recovery from the 2018 fourth quarter slump  The year ahead will open with the major indexes not just high but at technically overbought levels  and there s a good chance of a market correction sometime in the first quarter 
Next  some of 2019 s excitement was built around the buzz in the market for initial public offerings  But the most anticipated IPOs Uber  NYSE UBER   LYFT  NASDAQ LYFT  and WeWork proved problematic  That will cast a pall over the IPO market going forward 







Uber and Lyft are down 33  and 36   respectively  from where their IPOs opened   As they struggle to achieve profitability  they desperately need access to capital markets to expand 
WeWork s IPO was never even launched  The business plan made little sense to anyone  especially investors in its IPO  which was eventually pulled 
   And Some Upcoming Risks
Lastly  there s the upcoming election  including for president  a third of the Senate and the entire House of Representatives  If the House debate over impeaching Trump is any indication  it will be especially bitter 
Trump s campaign will say electing Democrats will doom the economy  although the stock market under Barack Obama performed better than the market under Trump  using each of their inaugurations as the starting dates for comparison 
And  if you assume the stock market is forward looking  it s fair to say Wall Street anticipates a Trump reelection

136,221651,UBER,This Decade In Tech,opinion,"A decade is a long time by any standards  but in technology  a decade is a lifetime  And in the last one  technology became a more fluid thing  filling gaps we never perceived existed  bringing people closer together like never before  making life much easier and permeating into areas where we didn t always want it 
For enterprises  this meant a bring your own device  BYOD  trend  melting away the distinction between consumer and enterprise usage that had until then been so important to maintain  This coupled with an entire revolution in mobile computing with tablets  hybrids and whatnot meant that employees could carry their devices practically anywhere  or even work from home 
All this is  of course  facilitated by the cloud  which  mostly through Amazon s   NASDAQ AMZN   AWS  but increasingly also Microsoft s   NASDAQ MSFT   Azure and to a lesser extent  Google Cloud   faithfully maintains the computing resources  programs and data generated  so companies have the option to scale as required while spending only to the extent of resources consumed  and employees enjoy greater flexibility and speed to achieve more desirable outcomes  Scores of companies providing specialized services have jumped on top of this infrastructure so everyone can do more for less 
Behind it all is another revolution in miniaturization and concentration of computer power  with integrated circuits getting even smaller and phones acquiring larger screens and becoming mini computers  housing every bit of information we could possibly need through the day  This  of course  increased anxiety about data theft that technology companies assuaged with biometric unlocking  including fingerprints  and most recently  facial recognition technology 
The app world saw sea changes  with some members like Amazon  Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   Music  Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX    Spotify   NYSE SPOT   and a few others pulling significantly ahead of the others  The digitization of entertainment happened with Chromecast  Roku  Apple TV  Netflix  etc   but many others are joining in as cord cutting has become an undeniable reality  With greater usage came greater variety in payment options and even more apps like Square   NYSE SQ   and Paypal   NASDAQ PYPL   gained popularity  Digital currencies and blockchain technology hold promise for the future 
Facebook   NASDAQ FB    disappearing messages from Instagram  before it was acquired by Facebook  and Snapchat   NYSE SNAP    and more recently  Tiktok has changed the way we communicate today  although Facebook s impact has perhaps been the most significant  And Twitter   NYSE TWTR   has become the go to place for breaking news when it isn t busy documenting celebrity gaffes 
While we had new iterations of Microsoft s Xbox  Sony s PS and the Nintendo Switch  gaming was really redefined with e sports as a new category  drawing millions of viewers and attracting significant ad dollars  Enhancing all that was new visual technology in the form of augmented and virtual realities 
Glasses overall progressed but weren t smashing hits as Google s version ran into privacy and other issues  Facebook s Oculus proved too expensive and Microsoft s HoloLens saw limited use  Still  companies and geeks remain interested in the possibilities as AR matured and made its way into iPhones 
Somewhere along the line  we realized that it would be fun to have our infotainment in our cars  so Apple s Carplay and Alphabet s   NASDAQ GOOGL   Android Auto were born 
Not satisfied with these improvements  and also perhaps concerned about the environment  we wondered what the future of automobiles would be like  And no sooner thought than done  we had companies like Tesla   NASDAQ TSLA   giving us all electric vehicles  in a full throated challenge to traditional automakers  We also had companies like Alphabet  Apple  Baidu   NASDAQ BIDU   and many others trying to figure out the mechanics of creating a self driving car  and even achieving millions of self driving test miles   
We re also more willing to share resources today because we ve discovered their scarcity and our ability to get by with less  So Uber  NYSE UBER   Lyft  NASDAQ LYFT  etc  have captured our imagination 
With people warming to ecommerce and home delivery  there are many companies willing to do the job for a nominal fee  And some have taken this a step further with drones  Regulation is playing catch up  but the tech that can carry a few pounds worth of goods to a certain destination without human intervention is available and ready to go 
On a more personal level  voice commands have become easier with personal assistants and digital home devices  although some people are tiring of automation devices crowding the home  But we re still interested in smart devices around our wrists  and these are getting more capable  Telling your watch to get things done is neither sci fi nor even a novelty any more  as the tech is going mainstream 
With all that data running between devices and clouds  there has  of course  also been a revolution in telecom networks  4G LTE has increased speeds that 5G will take much further  And software defined networking has lowered networking costs for enterprises 
Data mining  machine learning and artificial intelligence have been a natural follow on  and it s clear that tomorrow s leaders are those that have the most data today 
Oh  and did I forget 
All these things came at a cost  Security issues  data breaches  identity theft and privacy issues have become household items  The next decade may not solve these issues  but the number of lawsuits piling up indicates that there will be better definition of responsibilities 
Will everything be perfect in the future  I doubt it  But one thing I m sure of is that we ll make more progress

139,221654,UBER,SoftBank s Oyo lays off over 1 000 employees in India amid profit push,news,"By Sachin Ravikumar and Maria Ponnezhath
BENGALURU  Reuters    SoftBank backed  T 9984  Oyo Hotels and Homes is laying off hundreds of employees in India  according to a source and an internal memo seen by Reuters  as the loss making hotel chain cuts costs in pursuit of profits 
The move is part of a larger priority to drive profitability and sustainable growth  following a cash guzzling expansion spree that took Oyo to dozens of new markets including China and the United States  an email from Chief Executive Ritesh Agarwal to Oyo employees on Monday showed 
 Some roles at OYO will become redundant as we further drive tech enabled synergy  enhanced efficiency and remove duplication of effort across businesses or geographies   Agarwal wrote 
 As a result  we are asking some of our impacted colleagues to move to a new career outside of OYO  
The email did not disclose the number of layoffs  However  a person briefed on the matter said the layoffs impact more than 1 000 employees in India across senior  mid level and junior positions 
Four Oyo employees in the Indian cities of Bengaluru  Hyderabad  Kochi and the company s headquarters in Gurugram confirmed that employees were being asked to leave 
Local media have reported that Oyo was laying off anywhere between 1 000 and 2 000 employees in the country 
An Oyo representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
The cost cutting effort comes as Oyo s biggest investor SoftBank faces setbacks in some of its marquee investments  such as office sharing startup WeWork  which it is bailing out after a failed public listing 
Other investments by the Japanese technology giant  including Uber  N UBER   have also seen their valuations drop sharply 
Oyo  founded by Agarwal in 2013  has in particular been hit by a volley of unfavorable headlines in recent months 
It faces a growing backlash from several of its hotel partners  while internal projections have shown that Oyo may not make a profit in its two biggest markets until 2022  even as losses spiral

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Texas Instruments  TXN   Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR   CHTR  and Lowe s  LOW   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Texas Instruments  shares have underperformed the Zacks General Semiconductor industry year to date   36 1  vs   42 3    The Zacks analyst believes that Texas Instruments is being impacted by sluggish performance of Analog and Embedded Processing segments  Weakening end market conditions and U S  China trade tensions are also overhangs 
Further  weak customer momentum continues to impact the company s performance in communications equipment market  The stock has underperformed the industry on a year to date basis  Nevertheless  Texas Instruments remains confident about efficient manufacturing strategies  strong research and development activities 
Further  increasing investments in the automotive and industrial markets are anticipated to yield good returns for the company  However  high debt level and rising competitive pressure in the auto chip space are headwinds 
 You can  
Shares of Charter Communications have gained  18 3  in the past three months against the Zacks Cable TV industry s rise of  6   The Zacks analyst believes that the company is benefiting from growth in Internet  mobile  commercial and video revenues 
Increase in Internet speed at no extra cost is also aiding subscriber growth  Additionally  Charter s spectrum mobile products are gaining traction and subscriber base is increasing rapidly  Launch of spectrum mobile services to small and medium business customers is a key catalyst  Improving free cash flow is a growth driver 
However  commercial revenues continued to suffer due to migration of customers to Spectrum pricing  and packaging from Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House  Further  Charter persistently loses video subscribers  primarily due to cord cutting and intense competition from streaming service providers like Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  
 You can  
Lowe s shares have gained  20 6  over the past six months against the Zacks Building Products   Retail industry s rise of  10 3   The Zacks analyst believes that the stock received a boost when it reported third quarter fiscal 2019 results  wherein earnings grew year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Moreover  comps in the quarter increased  driven by solid performance in its U S  home improvement stores  Strong macroeconomic landscape along with constant efforts to enhance customers  experience  solid performance of the merchandise category and strength in the Pro business also bode well  Further  efforts to enhance online business led to robust comps growth in lowes com 
Encouragingly  management raised adjusted earnings guidance for fiscal 2019  However  high level of debt for the past few quarters may act as a deterrent  Also  the company is exposed to competition

It was an uneventful day on December 24  most certainly not like the one last year  I went back and read my blog post from that day  and times have changed  and the markets appear to be in precisely the opposite position  
But that doesn t mean we will continue to rise in a straight line  and signs are forming  which suggests we could be ready to see a minor pullback of perhaps 2  over the final four days of the year
